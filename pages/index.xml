      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Learning Scientist &amp;ndash; I study how to improve teaching and learning with technology. I work for Digital Promise, a nonprofit, where I am Executive Director of our Learning Sciences Research team. Most of my work has been about how to use technology to improve learning of mathematics and other STEM subjects.
My favorite hobbies are photography, jazz, backpacking and hiking.
With my wife Audrey ❤️, I live both in Silicon Valley and Washington DC.</description>
