      <title>2023 Abdullah Ibrahim</title>

      <description>At 88 years, Abdullah Ibrahim drew a huge crowd, filling the concert hall at the Kennedy Center on a Sunday evening. He began on solo piano, with floating melodies over hymn-like harmonies. Later, he was joined by a band of four horn players, a bass and a sax. The pattern throughout the evening was that Ibrahim rarely played with the band; rather, he played to set the mood for a tune or to bridge between tunes.</description>

      <description>Porchfest brings music to the streets, as people stroll the local Petworth neighborhood and bands perform from the porches of houses. This year our friends Pilar and Darlene joined us, and we ran into Carolyn and Octavio. The music ranged from immigrant folk to psychadelic jam to random accordion and beyond. It was a nice cool day and we had fun people watching the crowds, checking out lots of bands, and catching up with friends.</description>

      <description>The National Endowment of the Arts honors four Jazz Masters each year, and this year gave awards to Kenny Garrett, Regina Carter, Louis Hayes and Sue Mingus.
Although we didn&amp;rsquo;t have tickets, I hopped on a city bike and rode 27 minutes from our house to the Kennedy Center to wait for standby tickets. A fun group of earnest jazz fans began filling the line at 5:30 for a 7:15 ticket release.</description>

      <description>Peak cherry blossoms were waiting for us when we arrived this year in Washington, DC. After a few days of rain, we awoke to a glorious Sunday morning. Audrey and I hopped on the city bikes (with helmets, of course), and rode 30 minutes to the National Mall. We were greeted by peak crowds, all trying to get to Tidal Basin that surrounds the Jefferson Memorial.
Hundreds of crossing guards were out to guide the throngs.</description>

      <description>We tuned in to Jake Shimabukuru via streaming on Friday night, and to our surprise, we liked his music and entertaining style so much that we bought tickets for Sunday night. After a fun French dinner of crepes and French onion soup at Chez Maman West, we strolled over to SFJazz to catch the show. Jake performed a wide range of music from Flamenco-style to a rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody and While my Guitar Gently Weeps.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed Maria Schneider several times now, but this is the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve heard the Orchestra in San Francisco. The compositions were lush and original, and ranged across many of her albums. We were glad to have time to catch a quick meal of Thai food beforehand with Micah and Victoria. &amp;ldquo;Sputnik&amp;rdquo; was my favorite tune this time, with the encore &amp;ldquo;Walking by Flashlight&amp;rdquo; a close second.
Audrey ordered a copy of the book of poems that inspired many compositions, 100 Postcards to Jim Harrison.</description>

      <description>It was a cold and rainy Tuesday night. The smell of wet dogs and dry martinis wafting across the bay. The perfect night to slip out the door in an overcoat and head for an dark, dank watering hole.
And so I gingerly nudged the Q5 into the wilds of Hayward to see Micah Roschelle take the lead on Trombone with the Berkeley Alumni Big Band. That Micah, always ahead of his time!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll take you there&amp;rdquo; sings Mavis Staples, famously, and she did &amp;ndash; it was a soulful, happy place. The minimalist backup band, guitar-bass-drums, was outstanding &amp;ndash; filling the space with energy. We especially loved Rick Holstrom, a blues guitar player. He made his Telecaster sing in every way it should, extracting a series of tasty, and thrilling tones.
The church is still in Mavis Staples; we felt we were in a wonderful Sunday gospel service, with Mavis ever urging our spirits higher.</description>

      <description>Dance we must, as the motown groove of San Francisco favorite &amp;ldquo;Pride and Joy&amp;rdquo; is undeniable! And dance we did, all night long, with our friends Mike and Fong.
The packed house brought out every 55 year old in Menlo Park California who isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to boogie. When they band closed with &amp;ldquo;Shout!&amp;rdquo; it was quite entertaining to look around and see everyone (including us) complaining that we can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;get a little bit softer now; get a little bit lower now&amp;rdquo;—our knees hurt!</description>

      <description>Although I&amp;rsquo;m not much for attending fundraising events, I was glad to go out and support my favorite jazz club, the Bach Dynamite and Dancing Society. The San Mateo Community College Jazz band was a real treat. And I participated in the auction and won this cool framed photo, taken at the Bach.

      <description>Fred Armisen introduced his show as &amp;ldquo;comedy for musicians&amp;rdquo; - and indeed, it featured lots of funny talk about music. An evening with Fred Armisen is a bit more like hanging out with a slightly off-kilter, ironic cousin than it is like traditional standup comedy. He did impressions of punk rock in every country across the world. He put trotted out a bass guitar and chomped on the headstock, which turned out to be a brownie.</description>

      <description>Micah and I visited Jack London Square to hear one of the most amazing big bands on the planet, Gordon Goodwin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Phat Band.&amp;rdquo; And we were joined by an enthusiastic crowd with a line stretching out the door. Big band nerds of planet, unite!
The music was energetic, dazzling in complexity, and unfailingly tight. We especially liked the theme song from &amp;ldquo;The Incredibles&amp;rdquo;, which this band wrote and performed. Also a tribute to Looney Toons called &amp;ldquo;Hunting Wabbits.</description>

      <description>Walking into the newly remolded Guild in Menlo Park, we thought &amp;ldquo;we must know people here.&amp;rdquo; The crowd, how to put it? The crowd wore its age as well as we do.
Petty Theft had a great reputation as a Tom Petty cover band, and they delivered. We had a lot of fun dancing to the endless string of greatest hits. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have a venue so near our house with music we enjoy.</description>

      <description>What a treat to see one of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest bass players, Stanley Clarke, from the third row. Stanley famously founded Return to Forever with Chick Corea in the early 1970s and was Return to Forever was one of my introductions to Jazz in my youth. On this occasion, he was performing a tribute to Chick Corea with a band of amazing 20-something musicians. The set opened with the technically difficult Medieval Overture from 1976&amp;rsquo;s Romantic Warrior.</description>

      <description>In twelve photos, I reflect on 2022. It was a year of branching out and our plans blossomed, so I choose the Cherry Blossoms in Georgetown as the cover theme.
1. Washington DC: we&amp;rsquo;re here! Audrey looks to the future. In 2022, we officially added a second location in Washington DC to our life. Come visit us in Columbia Heights! (We&amp;rsquo;re there about half the year.)
2. And we&amp;rsquo;re not happy with the Supreme Court We made signs and joined the crowds gathered at the Washington Monument to protest the (then leaked, yet unannounced) Supreme Court decision on Abortion rights.</description>

      <description>I recently enjoyed a few days at Asilomar, near Monterey, California, while attending a NSF conference on Artificial Intelligence. The air was sparkling clear and fresh. Early the first morning I wandered down to the beach to watch the first rays of sun hit the sand.
Waves crashing on the rocks. Walking down to the beach. A lone seagull on the mirrored beach. The winding path back to the conference center.</description>

      <description>The historic 6th and I Synagogue provided a beautiful setting for a stunning set by Julian Lage and his trio, featuring bassist Jorge Roeder and drummer Dave King. Words that come to mind to describe the music: virtuoso, intricate, emotive, warm, engaging. What we all noted after the set was how much fun the band was having, and we were having fun right along with them.
Before the set, I snapped this photo of the wonderous dome above us.</description>

      <description>On a visit with Jacob in Denver, we looked at the last minute for some live music and discovered that Charged Particles was playing in downtown Denver. They were playing music of Michael Brecker, who was one of the heros of jazz in my high school years. For example, check out this 1980 performance of Some Skunk Funk.
Although Michael Brecker has passed away, his brother Randy joined the set on trumpet.</description>

      <description>Blues Alley recently had a fire, but Lisa Fischer burned the house down all over again. I learned of Fischer through a documentary about her backup singing in the Rolling Stones. Now she has her own solo career. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Lisa Fischer perform several times, but this was the best!
She has an amazing expressive range. At one point, she asked the audience to call out songs and she sang a minute of each.</description>

      <description>As the culmination of a great family visit with Amy, Len, Isla and Jack, we toured the Washington Monument. We were blessed with a very clear day and great views in every direction. After passing through security (some guy failed to get through with a large purple scissors), we were whisked 90 seconds up in an elevator to the top.

      <description>Fall is breaking out all over, and no where better then nearby Rock Creek Park. We love that Beach Dr is closed to cars; its the perfect weekend stroll. And because of the absense of cars anywhere nearby, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to experience complete quiet even though we&amp;rsquo;re in middle of DC.
A couple of weekends ago, we were walking here and Audrey spotted Justice Sonia Sotomayor walking by. A DC moment!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re really enjoying autumn in DC&amp;ndash;and so are Sugar Baby, Ollie, and Lola, who have gotten their humans to take them on many fun day trips. This time we ventured a little to Cacoctin Mountain Park in Maryland north of DC. (Pronounced &amp;ldquo;Ka-Kock-tin&amp;rdquo;).
A little over an hour of driving brought us to the beginning of our hike. The sky was a bit gray and the temperatures in the 60s. Ollie was especially excited and pulling hard on his leash.</description>

      <description>On a beautiful sunny fall day, Audrey, Carolyn and I ventured to Annapolis with Ollie, Sugar Baby and Lola. What&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful outing without three dogs? The dogs were especially delighted when we immediately came upon a Dog Treat Parlor on Main Street&amp;ndash;fresh biscuits for all!
Annapolis has a great collection of colonial architecture from different eras. At the visitor center we picked up a walking tour guide. The visitor center was on such a colorful street!</description>

      <description>On a beautiful fall day, I ventured to Great Falls National Park, just outside of Washington, DC. The air was clear, dry and just a little warm in the sun. Sugar Baby and Ollie came for the ride, and were delighted with the number of dogs at the park and the quality of the resulting smells.
Aside from three easy overlooks, the trails in the park mostly follow the cliff above the river.</description>

      <description>New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s finest guitar player, Al Di Meola, ventured to Washington DC for a club performance near the waterfront. I enjoyed the unusual configuration of the band. He brought along a unusual band: Tabla player Amit Kavthekar, Drummer Richie Morales, and another classical guitar player. I was lucky, because I showed up late and still found a seat only about five feet away. Perfect to watch a master guitar player in his art.</description>

      <description>For a delayed Father&amp;rsquo;s Day outing, Micah and I attended Bill Frisell &amp;amp; Trio at Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s historic Freight &amp;amp; Salvage club. The music was mostly quiet. And you could have heard a pin drop. Frisell&amp;rsquo;s virtuosity was on full display. In any minute of music, he conjured up more tones and textures than most guitar players find in an entire set. The final song was &amp;ldquo;What the World Needs Now (is love sweet love)&amp;rdquo; by Burt Bacharach.</description>

      <description>Devil&amp;rsquo;s Postpile National Monument is a natural wonder. It features tall columns of basalt. And they twist and bend in impossible contortions. A short hike a way brought us to 100=foot tall Rainbow Falls.
Micah and I visited the day before starting our backpacking trip. It was convenient, as there was a shuttle from our campsite to the Monument, including both destinations.</description>

      <description>My first time backpacking trip, 35 years ago, featured some High Sierra drama. Recently I took the same trip with Micah and was able to take the photo above, showing the route that accompanies the infamous tale. When I got home, I marked the route in red on the photo, with the key theoretical discussion.

      <description>This view from our campsite made every one of the 18,000 steps of the climb to Lake Ediza worth it. At 9300 ft elevation, this green gem has the classic Sierra Nevada look of just four elements: bright granite, green pines, clear water and blue sky. Lake Ediza is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the Inyo National Forest, near the Mammoth Ski Area.
About 35 years ago, Lake Ediza was my first backpacking trip.</description>

      <description>Stanley Clarke was a highlight at the San Jose Jazz Festival, but there was much more great music to enjoy.
Marina Crouse Band As we wandered into the grounds of the festival, Marina Crouse was singing a soulful and funky version of &amp;ldquo;Cisco Kid.&amp;rdquo; We arrived midway through her band&amp;rsquo;s set but enjoyed a few minutes on the grassy law at the Blues Stage.
LMR Jazz Orchestra Featuring Tierney Sutton Next we headed indoors for a real treat &amp;ndash; Tierney Sutton singing a set with a well-arranged and conducted Big Band.</description>

      <description>Ollie and I hiked a 3.5 hour loop to the top of Windy Hill and back. I love that we have such an amazing hike right from our front door. There was a cool breeze from the fog at the coast, but we had sunshine all the way. A perfect day for the hike!
When I first moved to California, my landlady informed me that the appearance of Amaryllis Belladonna (first flower picture) means &amp;ldquo;Back to School.</description>

      <description>Saturday night&amp;rsquo;s alright for retro punk, with Geri Vahey and the Seagulls making the scene. Micah and I met up in San Francisco and did a bike ride on the waterfront to Fort Mason and back. Then after some tasty empanadas at the Ferry Building, we headed to the Mission to check out Geri&amp;rsquo;s band.
First up was a teenage band doing their best Green Day. Meanwhile we took in the vibe of run-down, dimly lit bar &amp;ndash; cash only, mind you.</description>

      <description>In celebration of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s birthday and Father&amp;rsquo;s Day, we visited the new Guild venue to &amp;ldquo;take a journey&amp;rdquo; with Kamasi Washington and his powerful band. With two drummers, the beat was always intense and funky. Kamasi also brought a singer, keyboard player, trombone and flute/sax.
It was my first time at The Guild and I loved the new space. Also enjoyed seeing our ushers, Patti and Larry.
Tunes included a wonderful new song for Kamasi&amp;rsquo;s newborn and the powerful closing &amp;ldquo;Fists of Fury.</description>

      <description>A double bill of a quality that would be hard to find in New York City or anywhere in the world &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s how Stanford Jazz Workshop&amp;rsquo;s Jim Nadel introduced the show. And the music did not disappoint.
James Francies opened the show with his trio of Zach Moses (bass) and Eric Harland (drums). The music featured powerful open chords and interesting melodies. A lot of sustained chord sounds, maybe fourths.</description>

      <description>At dinner with Jacob, I enjoyed the local photos on display at the wonderful Love Lane Kitchen, on the wall just behind where we are seated. I mentioned this to our server and she said &amp;ldquo;Well, tell the photographer, she&amp;rsquo;s seated right behind you!&amp;rdquo; So I did. I told her I particularly admired her sunflower photos. But I also liked the barn she shot with an American flag painted on its side.</description>

      <description>Tradition continued in &amp;lsquo;22 with a great family clam dig in Peconic Bay. Would there be few clams this year? Only big chowder clams? Or a bonanza?
Around 11 am the first rakes hit the water. We were in luck! Just 20 feet from the water&amp;rsquo;s edge we quickly found beds of nice sized clams. Everyone took turns with the clam rakes, dragging through the water until you hit a bump, digging, and scooping up the clams.</description>

      <description>A beautiful Sunday took us to the beach just north of Half Moon Bay, to hear Tierney Sutton sing at the Bach Dynamite and Dancing Society. Her theme was &amp;ldquo;love.&amp;rdquo;
To open the show, Tierney sang a song from her &amp;ldquo;Blue&amp;rdquo; album, which featured Joni Mitchell songs. She playfully combined the standard &amp;ldquo;April in Paris&amp;rdquo; with Joni&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Free Man in Paris.&amp;rdquo; Later in the show, Tierney gave a tour-de-force performance of the Dry Cleaner from Des Moines, a Joni Mitchell song with a ton of very fast, very complex lyrics.</description>

      <description>Singing their original &amp;ldquo;I started out with nothing, and I still have most of it,&amp;rdquo; the gruffy gang from north, north Portola Valley won over the overheated Palooza crowd. Billie Steve &amp;ldquo;Spock&amp;rdquo; Dusse took center stage and played to the camera, so earns the most mug shots in the gallery. At this point, I guess I am Whiskey Hillbillies groupie, &amp;lsquo;cause they are always good fun. So follow them on Facebook and check out a show.</description>

      <description>Live from Berkeley, it&amp;rsquo;s Trombone Micah!
An evening drive up to Berkeley took me to the California Jazz Conservancy, where Micah has been taking an evening class and playing jazz. The group played a set with three tunes:
Four (Miles Davis) Anthropology (Charlie Parker) Nutville (Horace Silver) The music was joyful, challenging, and uptempo.
Interestingly, the group&amp;rsquo;s teacher, Dave LeFebre, was also my jazz teacher when I was a grad student at Berkeley, decades ago.</description>

      <description>The Roschelle family happily converged at Morningside Heights to celebrate Micah&amp;rsquo;s commencement from Columbia University. He actually graduated two years ago, in May 2020. But that was the year of coming home for spring break and never returning to New York to finish senior year. So it was great to finally have a full on celebration two years later. My mother, Alice, has a master&amp;rsquo;s degree from Columbia, making it a multi-generational roar of the Columbia lion.</description>

      <description>Audrey and I created some impromptu posters, hopped on the #54 bus, and joined the Washington DC Women&amp;rsquo;s March. We were protesting the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s draft decision to overturn Roe v Wade. Lots of people asked to take a photo of Audrey&amp;rsquo;s poster: &amp;ldquo;if men could get pregnant, abortions would be available at ATMs.&amp;rdquo;
The weather was misty, but warm, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t mind getting wet. The rally started on a lawn just below the Washington Monument.</description>

      <description>Danilo Peréz&amp;rsquo;s Global Messengers I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of Wayne Shorter&amp;rsquo;s quartet with Danilo Peréz, John Pattituci and Brian Blade. And I enjoy each of the artists individually. So I leaped at a chance go hear the pianist, Danilo Peréz lead his own group.
The setting could not be more beautiful. The 6th and I Synagogue is a historic building in downtown Washington DC, and its a Sephardic-style building.</description>

It was great to catch with college friends John and Sue Lang and their clan. Every kind of music was featured, most of it original. And the streets were overflowing with a relaxed audience, taking in the perfect weather and looking for the next great sound on a porch somewhere nearby.
Samba School One highlight was DC&amp;rsquo;s only Samba School, which got the whole audience involved in their joyous dances.</description>

My favorite photo is the goat in a bucket!
We got to the zoo by Lyft. As you may know, the National Zoo is on a hill.</description>

      <description>Late in the afternoon on Easter Sunday, I wandered through the streets of Georgetown, in Washington DC. It was very quiet. I love how actively people plan beautiful little displays of flowers in Washington DC, especially tulips at this time of year. Many houses have lamps which are lit with actual gas, not electricity. I also wondered along the historical canal that goes a hundred miles or so into Maryland. I&amp;rsquo;ve really been enjoying the long spring &amp;ndash; we started with spring in California in mid-January and now continuing it in DC well into mid-April.</description>

The history was that my former employer, SRI International, pursued and was awarded these patents based on research conducted in our Center for Technology in Learning on the topic of computer-supported collaborative learning, especially with mobile devices. As is typical, the patents are assigned to SRI; I don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; any rights in them.</description>

The audience rose and soared with the Star Spangled Banner. We grooved to Foxy Lady. We were awed by Jordan&amp;rsquo;s amazing guitar techniques, including lots of high speed tapping. For the guitar nerds out there, he had a series of awesome guitar tones all night long, which must have been driven by some electronics, as there was no guitar amp anywhere in site.</description>

With three fiddles, a pedal steel guitar, at least a half dozen singers, and more, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t go wrong. The music was a mix of country-western songs with lots of spirited improvisations, as Monday night is the night for the musicians to have fun. The night&amp;rsquo;s featured singer, Wendy, had been on The Voice and was wonderful.</description>
