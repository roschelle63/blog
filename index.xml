      <description>Union station in Washington DC is one of the most beautiful train stations in the United States. One afternoon, I had a great time wandering about and shooting photos.
 The station is fun for people watching, although some people frozen in stone.

      <description>Danilo Peréz&amp;rsquo;s Global Messengers I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of Wayne Shorter&amp;rsquo;s quartet with Danilo Peréz, John Pattituci and Brian Blade. And I enjoy each of the artists individually. So I leaped at a chance go hear the pianist, Danilo Peréz lead his own group.
The setting could not be more beautiful. The 6th and I Synagogue is a historic building in downtown Washington DC, and its a Sephardic-style building.</description>

      <title>Petworth Porchfest</title>

      <description>DC was rocking from its porches Saturday, as we strolled through &amp;ldquo;porchfest&amp;rdquo; in the nearby neighborhood of Petworth. It was great to catch with college friends John and Sue Lang and their clan. Every kind of music was featured, most of it original. And the streets were overflowing with a relaxed audience, taking in the perfect weather and looking for the next great sound on a porch somewhere nearby.
Samba School One highlight was DC&amp;rsquo;s only Samba School, which got the whole audience involved in their joyous dances.</description>

      <title>Visiting the National Zoo with Mom</title>

      <description>On a beautiful morning, we decided to visit the National Zoo. Alas the only panda we saw was a statue at the entrance! Mom tried to play with the seals, but they were more interested in the 5 and 6 year old kids running about.
My favorite photo is the goat in a bucket!
We got to the zoo by Lyft. As you may know, the National Zoo is on a hill.</description>

      <description>About a year ago, the dogs and I enjoyed a beautiful day on a California beach. Lola loves fetching a ball along the waterline. Ollie loves playing keep away with the ball. Both can run and run and run at the beach.
  I was looking for some photos to print and found these three shots. I really enjoyed looking back on them. I hope you do, too.

      <title>April in Georgetown, a stroll</title>

      <description>Late in the afternoon on Easter Sunday, I wandered through the streets of Georgetown, in Washington DC. It was very quiet. I love how actively people plan beautiful little displays of flowers in Washington DC, especially tulips at this time of year. Many houses have lamps which are lit with actual gas, not electricity. I also wondered along the historical canal that goes a hundred miles or so into Maryland. I&amp;rsquo;ve really been enjoying the long spring &amp;ndash; we started with spring in California in mid-January and now continuing it in DC well into mid-April.</description>

      <description>It seems cool that my name is on a few patents. As far as I know, these patents have never been used for anything. The history was that my former employer, SRI International, pursued and was awarded these patents based on research conducted in our Center for Technology in Learning on the topic of computer-supported collaborative learning, especially with mobile devices. As is typical, the patents are assigned to SRI; I don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; any rights in them.</description>

      <title>Stanley Jordan as Jimi</title>

      <description>Stanley Jordan brought the house down at Blues Alley in Georgetown with his recreation of Jimi Hendrix&amp;rsquo;s music. The audience rose and soared with the Star Spangled Banner. We grooved to Foxy Lady. We were awed by Jordan&amp;rsquo;s amazing guitar techniques, including lots of high speed tapping. For the guitar nerds out there, he had a series of awesome guitar tones all night long, which must have been driven by some electronics, as there was no guitar amp anywhere in site.</description>

      <description>Monday night in Nashville. What to do? We chose The Time Jumpers, a band that&amp;rsquo;s been together for 24 years. With three fiddles, a pedal steel guitar, at least a half dozen singers, and more, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t go wrong. The music was a mix of country-western songs with lots of spirited improvisations, as Monday night is the night for the musicians to have fun. The night&amp;rsquo;s featured singer, Wendy, had been on The Voice and was wonderful.</description>

      <description>The Charles Mingus Big Band My birthday present this year was the Charles Mingus Big Band live at Kennedy Center&amp;rsquo;s Terrace Theater. The band was there to celebrate Jazz Appreciation Month and the centential of the birth of iconic bass player and composer Charles Mingus. We were treated to a dynamic concert, full of energy and contrast.
Goodbye Pork Pie Hat A highlight was the second tune, a version of the Mingus composition &amp;ldquo;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&amp;rdquo; using the lyrics written by Joni Mitchell.</description>

      <description>We had a beautiful sunny day for my birthday. Jacob and I rode bikes to the National Mall, and visited the Tidal Basin. The Cherry Blossoms were well past their peak but still beautiful. As we were leaving the Tidal Basin, we came upon this monumental tulip collection.

      <description>On a lovely spring Sunday, we took Lola, Ollie and Sugar Baby for a walk at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. It felt very spacious and quiet. Trees were blooming everywhere. We were surprised to find huge columns, which were moved here from the Capitol when it was expanded. The dogs loved their walk and so did we.

      <description>We were lucky to be in Washington DC for the cherry blossoms. We decided to take a morning off from work and picked the perfect sunny morning. It was so festive: lots of people taking photos in fancy dresses, people dancing, and everyone just having a great time!
