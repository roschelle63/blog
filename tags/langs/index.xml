      <description>DC was rocking from its porches Saturday, as we strolled through &amp;ldquo;porchfest&amp;rdquo; in the nearby neighborhood of Petworth. It was great to catch with college friends John and Sue Lang and their clan. Every kind of music was featured, most of it original. And the streets were overflowing with a relaxed audience, taking in the perfect weather and looking for the next great sound on a porch somewhere nearby.
Samba School One highlight was DC&amp;rsquo;s only Samba School, which got the whole audience involved in their joyous dances.</description>
