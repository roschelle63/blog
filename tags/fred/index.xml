      <description>The best young jazz drummer in the UK played DC&amp;rsquo;s historic Howard Theater, and this was the perfect occasion for 13-year old Charlie&amp;rsquo;s first concert. Charlie is Audrey&amp;rsquo;s nephew and an aspiring drummer. After fortifying ourselves at Ben&amp;rsquo;s Chili Bowl with Half Smokes, we join a young and diverse crowd waiting through a DJ&amp;rsquo;s set to get to the main show. We positioned our selves in the standing-room-only crowd with some space by the sound board.</description>

      <description>The Charles Mingus Big Band My birthday present this year was the Charles Mingus Big Band live at Kennedy Center&amp;rsquo;s Terrace Theater. The band was there to celebrate Jazz Appreciation Month and the centential of the birth of iconic bass player and composer Charles Mingus. We were treated to a dynamic concert, full of energy and contrast.
Goodbye Pork Pie Hat A highlight was the second tune, a version of the Mingus composition &amp;ldquo;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&amp;rdquo; using the lyrics written by Joni Mitchell.</description>
