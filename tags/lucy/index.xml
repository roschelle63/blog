      <description>A high point of Audrey&amp;rsquo;s birthday celebration weekend was a family trip to the Kamala Harris rally in Madison, Wisconsin. We were in the 4th row, behind the podium. It was loud, colorful and exciting.
Getting in required a very long walk around the stadium perimeter to get to the security screening area. Secret service dogs were sniffing people as they entered. We had to show id to check in, and then passed through an airport screening machine.</description>

      <description>In July, the fields of Wisconsin are filled with flowers. We&amp;rsquo;re delighted to have Lucy visiting with us from LA. Last night we watched fireworks all around Lake Monona. Today we went to a dog park and had a great hike among these lovely flowers.
