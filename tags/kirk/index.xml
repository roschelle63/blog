      <description>&lt;p&gt;Without question, Bob James stole the show at the 2025 Capital Jazz Festival. He took the stage with his own quartet and at 85 years old, he probably had more years than the  drummer, bass, and sax player combined. But his sound was still spritely and he didn&amp;rsquo;t miss a note. Bob is a composer often featured at your favorite &amp;ldquo;smooth jazz&amp;rdquo; setting of the radio dial, with a nack for writing tunes with memorable hooks. He played many of his classic compositions and a few covers. His band featured a talented young drummer and energetic bass player. And the Ukrainian sax player Andrey Chmut played several powerful solos, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
