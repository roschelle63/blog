      <description>Hitting the trail Our quest for the perfect lake in California&amp;rsquo;s Sierra Nevada continued this year with backpacking in the Desolation Wilderness. This year Micah Jacob and I were joined by a special guest: nephew Jack. We planned a four day trip:
From the Wright Lake trailhead to Maude Lake Then over the Rockbound Pass at nearly 9000 feet, to Lake Schmidell A day hike, return to camp at Lake Schmidell Return 9 miles to Wright Lake Day One: To Maude Lake We left chilly, foggy San Francisco at about 9:30 am and arrived at Wright Lake for a lunch of fresh Indian dips, procured from the Noe Valley Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market.</description>

      <description>As the culmination of a great family visit with Amy, Len, Isla and Jack, we toured the Washington Monument. We were blessed with a very clear day and great views in every direction. After passing through security (some guy failed to get through with a large purple scissors), we were whisked 90 seconds up in an elevator to the top.
