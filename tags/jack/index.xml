      <description>As the culmination of a great family visit with Amy, Len, Isla and Jack, we toured the Washington Monument. We were blessed with a very clear day and great views in every direction. After passing through security (some guy failed to get through with a large purple scissors), we were whisked 90 seconds up in an elevator to the top.
Jefferson Memorial and the Tidal Basin (South) The Potomac River flows out beyond the memorial.</description>
