      <description>We had a wonderful time among the Capulet and Montague families at the Kennedy Center. After the hopeful first half, Audrey wisely noted &amp;ldquo;This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to end well.&amp;rdquo; The closing scene was the best part of the opera, even if the lovers will only be together in the afterlife. The Kennedy Center is a great place to see an opera.
Details Location: Kennedy Center, Washington DC Date: November 18, 2023 Attending: Jeremy, Audrey, Eddie, Beth </description>

      <description>The Charles Mingus Big Band My birthday present this year was the Charles Mingus Big Band live at Kennedy Center&amp;rsquo;s Terrace Theater. The band was there to celebrate Jazz Appreciation Month and the centential of the birth of iconic bass player and composer Charles Mingus. We were treated to a dynamic concert, full of energy and contrast.
Goodbye Pork Pie Hat A highlight was the second tune, a version of the Mingus composition &amp;ldquo;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&amp;rdquo; using the lyrics written by Joni Mitchell.</description>
