      <description>&lt;p&gt;On opening night for Porgy and Bess at the Kennedy Center, Audrey, Karen, Kayla and I had perfect seats about a half dozen rows behind the orchestra pit. Close enough to see the beads of sweat on Porgy after his climatic fight with Crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey made me swear not to sing along to &amp;ldquo;Summertime&amp;rdquo; and anyway, as an amazing soprano was in the lead, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even dare try. Before the show, we toured the Kennedy Center, checking out the museum exhibit about Kennedy and the arts as well as the great view from the fourth floor terrace. There was also an extensive museum exhibit about Porgy and Bess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
