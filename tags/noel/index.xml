      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monday night in Nashville. What to do? We chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thetimejumpers.com/&#34;&gt;The Time Jumpers&lt;/a&gt;, a band that&amp;rsquo;s been together for 24 years. With three fiddles, a pedal steel guitar, at least a half dozen singers, and more, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t go wrong. The music was a mix of country-western songs with lots of spirited improvisations, as Monday night is the night for the musicians to have fun. The night&amp;rsquo;s featured singer, Wendy, had been on The Voice and was wonderful. I also was amazed by the pedal steel player who produced tasty licks and precision high speed runs all night long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
