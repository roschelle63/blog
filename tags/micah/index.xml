      <description>Micah and I visited Jack London Square to hear one of the most amazing big bands on the planet, Gordon Goodwin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Phat Band.&amp;rdquo; And we were joined by an enthusiastic crowd with a line stretching out the door. Big band nerds of planet, unite!
The music was energetic, dazzling in complexity, and unfailingly tight. We especially liked the theme song from &amp;ldquo;The Incredibles&amp;rdquo;, which this band wrote and performed. Also a tribute to Looney Toons called &amp;ldquo;Hunting Wabbits.</description>

      <description>What a treat to see one of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest bass players, Stanley Clarke, from the third row. Stanley famously founded Return to Forever with Chick Corea in the early 1970s and was Return to Forever was one of my introductions to Jazz in my youth. On this occasion, he was performing a tribute to Chick Corea with a band of amazing 20-something musicians. The set opened with the technically difficult Medieval Overture from 1976&amp;rsquo;s Romantic Warrior.</description>

      <title>Bill Frisell at the Freight &amp; Salvage</title>

      <description>For a delayed Father&amp;rsquo;s Day outing, Micah and I attended Bill Frisell &amp;amp; Trio at Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s historic Freight &amp;amp; Salvage club. The music was mostly quiet. And you could have heard a pin drop. Frisell&amp;rsquo;s virtuosity was on full display. In any minute of music, he conjured up more tones and textures than most guitar players find in an entire set. The final song was &amp;ldquo;What the World Needs Now (is love sweet love)&amp;rdquo; by Burt Bacharach.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Falls and Devil&#39;s Postpile</title>

      <description>Devil&amp;rsquo;s Postpile National Monument is a natural wonder. It features tall columns of basalt. And they twist and bend in impossible contortions. A short hike a way brought us to 100=foot tall Rainbow Falls.
Micah and I visited the day before starting our backpacking trip. It was convenient, as there was a shuttle from our campsite to the Monument, including both destinations.</description>

      <title>Backpacking to Lake Ediza</title>

      <description>This view from our campsite made every one of the 18,000 steps of the climb to Lake Ediza worth it. At 9300 ft elevation, this green gem has the classic Sierra Nevada look of just four elements: bright granite, green pines, clear water and blue sky. Lake Ediza is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the Inyo National Forest, near the Mammoth Ski Area.
About 35 years ago, Lake Ediza was my first backpacking trip.</description>

      <description>Saturday night&amp;rsquo;s alright for retro punk, with Geri Vahey and the Seagulls making the scene. Micah and I met up in San Francisco and did a bike ride on the waterfront to Fort Mason and back. Then after some tasty empanadas at the Ferry Building, we headed to the Mission to check out Geri&amp;rsquo;s band.
First up was a teenage band doing their best Green Day. Meanwhile we took in the vibe of run-down, dimly lit bar &amp;ndash; cash only, mind you.</description>

      <description>Live from Berkeley, it&amp;rsquo;s Trombone Micah!
An evening drive up to Berkeley took me to the California Jazz Conservancy, where Micah has been taking an evening class and playing jazz. The group played a set with three tunes:
Four (Miles Davis) Anthropology (Charlie Parker) Nutville (Horace Silver) The music was joyful, challenging, and uptempo.
Interestingly, the group&amp;rsquo;s teacher, Dave LeFebre, was also my jazz teacher when I was a grad student at Berkeley, decades ago.</description>

      <title>Micah&#39;s Delayed Commencement</title>

      <description>The Roschelle family happily converged at Morningside Heights to celebrate Micah&amp;rsquo;s commencement from Columbia University. He actually graduated two years ago, in May 2020. But that was the year of coming home for spring break and never returning to New York to finish senior year. So it was great to finally have a full on celebration two years later. My mother, Alice, has a master&amp;rsquo;s degree from Columbia, making it a multi-generational roar of the Columbia lion.</description>
