      <description>As the lights dimmed, members of Shakti entered the stage to a thunderous standing ovation. The minimal stage set (a low riser, draped in black, and spread with a few Indian carpets) gave few clues to the amazingly complex music soon to follow. As the musicians took their cross-legged seats, a subtle droning sound filled the room. The musicians tuned their instruments casually and settled into their places, like friends relaxing at home.</description>

      <description>Roy Pea and I were thrilled to catch Buddy Guy, now age 87, and still an icon of the blues playing a free concert in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s summer series at Stern Grove. Buddy urged the crowd to sing, dance, and celebrate his music; and the crowd of 10,000 responded. Buddy started with &amp;ldquo;Damn right, I&amp;rsquo;ve got the blues,&amp;rdquo; showed he was still a Hoochie Coochie man, and probably would have played all night if they didn&amp;rsquo;t keep reminding him to get off the stage.</description>
