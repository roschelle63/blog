      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a warm September night, Roy and I ventured to Shoreline to see The Who&amp;rsquo;s final tour. Could Roger Daltry&amp;rsquo;s voice still fill an ampitheater? Could Pete Townsend&amp;rsquo;s guitar still push the band into overdrive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was &amp;ldquo;yes!&amp;rdquo; The band covered their hits from the early 1960s through the 1980s and overall they sounded great. In their classic years, the Who were the sound of youth, full of unbridled energy and raw emotions. It was inspiring to see two 80-something rock legends play with much of that energy for a full two hour set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shakti 50th Anniversary Tour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the lights dimmed, members of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shakti50.com/&#34;&gt;Shakti&lt;/a&gt; entered the stage to a thunderous standing ovation. The minimal stage set (a low riser, draped in black, and spread with a few Indian carpets) gave few clues to the amazingly complex music soon to follow. As the musicians took their cross-legged seats, a subtle droning sound filled the room. The musicians tuned their instruments casually and settled into their places, like friends relaxing at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Buddy Guy at Stern Grove</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Roy Pea and I were thrilled to catch Buddy Guy, now age 87, and still an icon of the blues playing a free concert in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s summer series at Stern Grove. Buddy urged the crowd to sing, dance, and celebrate his music; and the crowd of 10,000 responded. Buddy started with &amp;ldquo;Damn right, I&amp;rsquo;ve got the blues,&amp;rdquo; showed he was still a Hoochie Coochie man, and probably would have played all night if they didn&amp;rsquo;t keep reminding him to get off the stage. Close to the end of the show, Buddy walked through the crowd while still playing his guitar as security cleared his way. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
