      <description>Our May 2023 visit to Madiera was a magical experience. After arriving on a quick two hour flight south from Lisbon, we soon found ourselves in a paradise of flowers, butterflies, steep mountain landscapes, flowing water, and adventure.
Our first stop after picking up a rental car and checking into our hotel was to visit a lookout point, Cabo Girao. Here a skywalk juts out from a cliff, 580 meters above the ocean.</description>

      <description>Bass players do not often lead bands, but then again, Marcus Miller is not your average bass player. It was a treat to bring Audrey&amp;rsquo;s brother&amp;rsquo;s family—Gene, Laem and Cliff—to the Birchmere Music Hall in Alexandria, VA to see Marcus Miller lead a long and energetic set.
A rendition of Mr. Pastorius was a high point of the set, although it was also the only swing jazz tune. More typical to the set was Detroit, a funky, energetic composition which Marcus renamed &amp;ldquo;Detroit DMV&amp;rdquo; for the evening.</description>

      <description>A night at the opera! Audrey and I took Mom and Paul a double first: their first time at the Kennedy Center and our first time at the opera. The night was warm and beautiful, so we enjoyed people watching outdoors before the show. We also really enjoyed the opera. It was unexpectedly funny, and of course, romantic and tragic. The sets and costumes were not overdone, but still made for a spectacle.</description>

      <description>Porchfest brings music to the streets, as people stroll the local Petworth neighborhood and bands perform from the porches of houses. This year our friends Pilar and Darlene joined us, and we ran into Carolyn and Octavio. The music ranged from immigrant folk to psychadelic jam to random accordion and beyond. It was a nice cool day and we had fun people watching the crowds, checking out lots of bands, and catching up with friends.</description>

      <description>The National Endowment of the Arts honors four Jazz Masters each year, and this year gave awards to Kenny Garrett, Regina Carter, Louis Hayes and Sue Mingus.
Although we didn&amp;rsquo;t have tickets, I hopped on a city bike and rode 27 minutes from our house to the Kennedy Center to wait for standby tickets. A fun group of earnest jazz fans began filling the line at 5:30 for a 7:15 ticket release.</description>

      <description>Peak cherry blossoms were waiting for us when we arrived this year in Washington, DC. After a few days of rain, we awoke to a glorious Sunday morning. Audrey and I hopped on the city bikes (with helmets, of course), and rode 30 minutes to the National Mall. We were greeted by peak crowds, all trying to get to Tidal Basin that surrounds the Jefferson Memorial.
Hundreds of crossing guards were out to guide the throngs.</description>

      <description>We tuned in to Jake Shimabukuru via streaming on Friday night, and to our surprise, we liked his music and entertaining style so much that we bought tickets for Sunday night. After a fun French dinner of crepes and French onion soup at Chez Maman West, we strolled over to SFJazz to catch the show. Jake performed a wide range of music from Flamenco-style to a rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody and While my Guitar Gently Weeps.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed Maria Schneider several times now, but this is the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve heard the Orchestra in San Francisco. The compositions were lush and original, and ranged across many of her albums. We were glad to have time to catch a quick meal of Thai food beforehand with Micah and Victoria. &amp;ldquo;Sputnik&amp;rdquo; was my favorite tune this time, with the encore &amp;ldquo;Walking by Flashlight&amp;rdquo; a close second.
Audrey ordered a copy of the book of poems that inspired many compositions, 100 Postcards to Jim Harrison.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll take you there&amp;rdquo; sings Mavis Staples, famously, and she did &amp;ndash; it was a soulful, happy place. The minimalist backup band, guitar-bass-drums, was outstanding &amp;ndash; filling the space with energy. We especially loved Rick Holstrom, a blues guitar player. He made his Telecaster sing in every way it should, extracting a series of tasty, and thrilling tones.
The church is still in Mavis Staples; we felt we were in a wonderful Sunday gospel service, with Mavis ever urging our spirits higher.</description>

      <description>Dance we must, as the motown groove of San Francisco favorite &amp;ldquo;Pride and Joy&amp;rdquo; is undeniable! And dance we did, all night long, with our friends Mike and Fong.
The packed house brought out every 55 year old in Menlo Park California who isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to boogie. When they band closed with &amp;ldquo;Shout!&amp;rdquo; it was quite entertaining to look around and see everyone (including us) complaining that we can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;get a little bit softer now; get a little bit lower now&amp;rdquo;—our knees hurt!</description>

      <description>Fred Armisen introduced his show as &amp;ldquo;comedy for musicians&amp;rdquo; - and indeed, it featured lots of funny talk about music. An evening with Fred Armisen is a bit more like hanging out with a slightly off-kilter, ironic cousin than it is like traditional standup comedy. He did impressions of punk rock in every country across the world. He put trotted out a bass guitar and chomped on the headstock, which turned out to be a brownie.</description>

      <description>Walking into the newly remolded Guild in Menlo Park, we thought &amp;ldquo;we must know people here.&amp;rdquo; The crowd, how to put it? The crowd wore its age as well as we do.
Petty Theft had a great reputation as a Tom Petty cover band, and they delivered. We had a lot of fun dancing to the endless string of greatest hits. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have a venue so near our house with music we enjoy.</description>

      <description>The historic 6th and I Synagogue provided a beautiful setting for a stunning set by Julian Lage and his trio, featuring bassist Jorge Roeder and drummer Dave King. Words that come to mind to describe the music: virtuoso, intricate, emotive, warm, engaging. What we all noted after the set was how much fun the band was having, and we were having fun right along with them.
Before the set, I snapped this photo of the wonderous dome above us.</description>

      <description>Fall is breaking out all over, and no where better then nearby Rock Creek Park. We love that Beach Dr is closed to cars; its the perfect weekend stroll. And because of the absense of cars anywhere nearby, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to experience complete quiet even though we&amp;rsquo;re in middle of DC.
A couple of weekends ago, we were walking here and Audrey spotted Justice Sonia Sotomayor walking by. A DC moment!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re really enjoying autumn in DC&amp;ndash;and so are Sugar Baby, Ollie, and Lola, who have gotten their humans to take them on many fun day trips. This time we ventured a little to Cacoctin Mountain Park in Maryland north of DC. (Pronounced &amp;ldquo;Ka-Kock-tin&amp;rdquo;).
A little over an hour of driving brought us to the beginning of our hike. The sky was a bit gray and the temperatures in the 60s. Ollie was especially excited and pulling hard on his leash.</description>

      <description>On a beautiful sunny fall day, Audrey, Carolyn and I ventured to Annapolis with Ollie, Sugar Baby and Lola. What&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful outing without three dogs? The dogs were especially delighted when we immediately came upon a Dog Treat Parlor on Main Street&amp;ndash;fresh biscuits for all!
Annapolis has a great collection of colonial architecture from different eras. At the visitor center we picked up a walking tour guide. The visitor center was on such a colorful street!</description>

      <description>I pulled out my best western shirt to join Audrey and a sea of pink cowboy hats at the Chicks concert. &amp;ldquo;With 33 million certified albums sold and sales of 27.9 million albums in the US, the Chicks have become the best-selling female band and best-selling country group in the US.&amp;rdquo; (per Wikipedia) Audrey knew all the words and was not shy about singing and dancing along to the two hour set.</description>

      <description>A beautiful Sunday took us to the beach just north of Half Moon Bay, to hear Tierney Sutton sing at the Bach Dynamite and Dancing Society. Her theme was &amp;ldquo;love.&amp;rdquo;
To open the show, Tierney sang a song from her &amp;ldquo;Blue&amp;rdquo; album, which featured Joni Mitchell songs. She playfully combined the standard &amp;ldquo;April in Paris&amp;rdquo; with Joni&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Free Man in Paris.&amp;rdquo; Later in the show, Tierney gave a tour-de-force performance of the Dry Cleaner from Des Moines, a Joni Mitchell song with a ton of very fast, very complex lyrics.</description>

      <description>The Roschelle family happily converged at Morningside Heights to celebrate Micah&amp;rsquo;s commencement from Columbia University. He actually graduated two years ago, in May 2020. But that was the year of coming home for spring break and never returning to New York to finish senior year. So it was great to finally have a full on celebration two years later. My mother, Alice, has a master&amp;rsquo;s degree from Columbia, making it a multi-generational roar of the Columbia lion.</description>

      <description>Audrey and I created some impromptu posters, hopped on the #54 bus, and joined the Washington DC Women&amp;rsquo;s March. We were protesting the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s draft decision to overturn Roe v Wade. Lots of people asked to take a photo of Audrey&amp;rsquo;s poster: &amp;ldquo;if men could get pregnant, abortions would be available at ATMs.&amp;rdquo;
The weather was misty, but warm, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t mind getting wet. The rally started on a lawn just below the Washington Monument.</description>

      <description>Danilo Peréz&amp;rsquo;s Global Messengers I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of Wayne Shorter&amp;rsquo;s quartet with Danilo Peréz, John Pattituci and Brian Blade. And I enjoy each of the artists individually. So I leaped at a chance go hear the pianist, Danilo Peréz lead his own group.
The setting could not be more beautiful. The 6th and I Synagogue is a historic building in downtown Washington DC, and its a Sephardic-style building.</description>

      <description>Stanley Jordan brought the house down at Blues Alley in Georgetown with his recreation of Jimi Hendrix&amp;rsquo;s music. The audience rose and soared with the Star Spangled Banner. We grooved to Foxy Lady. We were awed by Jordan&amp;rsquo;s amazing guitar techniques, including lots of high speed tapping. For the guitar nerds out there, he had a series of awesome guitar tones all night long, which must have been driven by some electronics, as there was no guitar amp anywhere in site.</description>

      <description>The Charles Mingus Big Band My birthday present this year was the Charles Mingus Big Band live at Kennedy Center&amp;rsquo;s Terrace Theater. The band was there to celebrate Jazz Appreciation Month and the centential of the birth of iconic bass player and composer Charles Mingus. We were treated to a dynamic concert, full of energy and contrast.
Goodbye Pork Pie Hat A highlight was the second tune, a version of the Mingus composition &amp;ldquo;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&amp;rdquo; using the lyrics written by Joni Mitchell.</description>

Trees were blooming everywhere. We were surprised to find huge columns, which were moved here from the Capitol when it was expanded. The dogs loved their walk and so did we.</description>
