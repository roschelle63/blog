Recently I took the same trip with Micah and was able to take the photo above, showing the route that accompanies the infamous tale. When I got home, I marked the route in red on the photo, with the key theoretical discussion.\nThe Story of My First Backpacking Trip As a graduate student in about 1987, I was invited on a backpacking trip by my fellow student and experienced trailblazer, Mike Sipusic. It started innocently enough with a hike from the trailhead to a campsite beside Lake Ediza, at the bottom of the red line in the photo.\nA Little Day Hike I slept well on my first night in the wilderness, and awoke excited to spend the day exploring the environs of our Lake Ediza campsite. Mike suggested off-trail adventure to the gap in the mountains at the top of the red line. Although we couldn\u0026rsquo;t scale Mount Ritter nor climb a Minaret, Mike thought we could get to the gap in the mountain and we\u0026rsquo;d be sure to see a great view out the other side.\nSo on a bright blue morning, we began our hike. First we crossed a small stream, hopping across stones. We noticed a black cloud passing overhead, but soon it disappeared and the sky was again clear and blue.\nThe View from the Top We worked our way up through a high mountain meadow, with thinning low grass. When we reached the top of the meadow, we traversed towards our goal\u0026ndash;the gap in the mountain. Then we skirted a large snow field (not shown in the photo, which was taken later in the season) We were clinbing to an elevation well over 10,000 feet, and the going was slow as we had to stop often to catch our breath. After the snow field, we realized that to get the top, we\u0026rsquo;ve have to climb over chaotic, loose slabs of fallen rock: talus. That was really slow going, as we neared the desired viewpoint.\nNot What We Expected When we got close to the top, we suddenly realized there would be no view. Instead, the black cloud was back. And it was coming our way!\nOn the Run With black cloud vapor beginning to pour over the mountain towards us, even a newbie backpacker like me realized it was time to make like a granite slab and split. We slip-slided our way back down the loose talus slope as fast as we could. When we got to the snow field, we didn\u0026rsquo;t skirt it. Instead we took big long strides through the show, going 4-5 feet down with each step. As we neared the bottom of the snow\u0026hellip;\nHail! Big, hard hailstones became to fall on us. It was painful and cold. And it was raining a hard cold rain, too. After completed the traverse, we found a boulder that was so big it made a cave underneath. We hid in the cave to wait out the hail. After 10-15 minutes, the rain and hail began to subside, and yet\u0026hellip;\nThe Theory of Lightning Now lightning began. You can\u0026rsquo;t understand the bible if you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard lightning in a mountain range. The sound defines \u0026ldquo;awesome.\u0026rdquo; This form of heavenly communication terrified our ancestors, and now I knew why. We realized we really should get out of there and started down the mountain as fast as we good. The lightning seemed to get closer, with loud CRACKS just seconds from the flashes of light. We could see lightning strikes behind us and the storm seemed to be coming our way.\nMike said: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, Jeremy, the peaks will draw the lightning strikes.\u0026rdquo;\nAt that very moment, we saw a huge flash! A bolt of lightning smote a lone tree at our campsite, thousands of feet below us.\n\u0026ldquo;There goes that theory,\u0026rdquo; I countered.\nCrossing the River We scrambled down the meadow we had climbed up earlier, but now with blue sky replaced by lightning bolts all around us. The safety of camp seemed within reach. But when we got to the little stream we had crossed in the morning, we had another surprise. It had turned into a torrent!\nThere was a fallen tree we could still walk across, but it seemed quite slim and the current was scary.\nMike jumped in the stream and braced himself on the tree. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m strong!\u0026rdquo; he offered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll help you cross.\u0026rdquo; And indeed, Mike helped our group get across the tree to the side of the river with our camp. Then, soaked, he climbed out of the raging river.\nHypothermia and Recovery Mike was starting to get hypothermia. We hustled to our camp and got his wet clothes off and dry long underwear on and got him into a sleeping bag. I got into the sleeping bag with Mike to warm him up. Gail made him a hot drink. Mike recovered. And the rest of the trip was uneventful.\nYet, the famous line and rejoinder lived on \u0026ldquo;The peaks will draw the lightning\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;there goes that theory!\u0026rdquo;\nWondering, 35 Years Later Now, revisting the same area, I wonder if we were even on the right trail. Micah found the really great view of the Minarets. It was indeed up and across a loose talus slope, but different from the one we climbed. He found the great view at a gap near Iceberg Lake. Iceberg Lake today has a well-marked trail and even a faint trail across the rock slabs. I wonder if we were actually looking for the pass near Iceberg Lake instead try to climb to a gap in the Minarets?\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202209-35yearsago/","summary":"My first time backpacking trip, 35 years ago, featured some High Sierra drama.

At 9300 ft elevation, this green gem has the classic Sierra Nevada look of just four elements: bright granite, green pines, clear water and blue sky. Lake Ediza is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the Inyo National Forest, near the Mammoth Ski Area.\nAbout 35 years ago, Lake Ediza was my first backpacking trip. I was a graduate student at Berkeley then, and went with my friend and fellow student, Mike Sipusic. Now I was taking my son Micah, also a graduate student at Berkeley, on the same adventure. Well, maybe without the hail and lightning, but that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another blog.\nThis time our adventure began with a 6 hour drive east through Yosemite\u0026rsquo;s Tioga pass to Mono Lake and then south to Mammoth. From there, we boarded a shuttle to a campground in Agnew Meadows. We stayed overnight in the campground to get adjusted to the 8000 ft initial elevation and began our hike the next morning.\n Day 1: Climbing to Lake Ediza The trip began along the headwaters of California\u0026rsquo;s longest river, the San Joaquin, before climbing our first set of switchbacks to along Shadow Creek, to arrive at the beautiful Shadow Lake. From here we could spot Mt Ritter in the distance\u0026ndash;our destination.\nClick photos to enlarge. Where\u0026rsquo;s Micah? Ahead of me of course!

We couldn't believe the gorgeous jade color of the lake. The lake water it was pretty warm, considering that the green color comes from glacial melt. Cool down, dust off!  Soon it was time for sunset.\n Day 2: Photo Paradise! We woke to beautiful reflections on the still lake. Micah prepared oatmeal breakfast with the jetboil with a gorgeous view of the Minarets at his back (note our tent below him).\nAs we began our morning-shade climb at the signpost to reach a 10,000 foot elevation, we had an amazing panorama of Lake Ediza and the twin 13,000 peaks named Ritter and Banner. After a 45 minute upwards hike, we arrived at Iceberg Lake, and evening more stunning green, and right up against the Minarets. Snow still there on Labor Day weekend! Micah climbed the haphazard pile of rocks to the left of Iceberg Lake to an even higher lake and a bigger view.\nI sauntered back down the trail, wandering off trail to get my favorite photo of the trip. The depth of the landscape and its barren, above-tree-line simplicity captures \u0026ldquo;wilderness.\u0026rdquo; I like the u-shaped glacial valley heading back to Ritter and Banner.

Over and out Soon it was time to leave. The eight miles downhill went faster of course. Micah raced ahead of me, but I was motivated to keep up: a team of four youngsters was blasting awful music as they hiked and I was desparate to stay ahead and out of earshot.

I decided I\u0026rsquo;d head back one night to try to create a similar photo. It turned out to be hard to get the photo you see above, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get light from the sunset. Indeed, at sunset it looks like a silhouette.\nInitially I gave up and drove away. Instead, I found this other barn, just a bit down the road. The light was brighter on this one, so I snapped its picture.\n Then I decided to check out the Mattituck Inlet, about a 5 minute drive away, and just a short stroll from Love Lane (the main street of Mattituck), where Jacob and I had our delicious dinner. I snapped this photo as the sun went below the trees at the horizon.\nNearby, two young girls were jumping off a fishing boat and swimming in the salt lagoon. Just beyond the girls, an older couple was drinking wine on their boat and watching the sunset. All around me, snappers were jumping out of the water to eat their final meal of the day. I hoped they were eating lots of the gnats that were attacking me.\n Although the sunset was not yet over at the Inlet, the gnats were annoying, so reluctantly, I left. Next stop was the historic Hallockville Museum Farm, for this windmill.\n I wondered if I\u0026rsquo;d have time to make back to the inspirational barn, which was about 5-10 minutes away. I decided it was worth a try, especially since I noticed an odd phenomena. The sunset had already peaked on the horizon, but it was still getting better directly overhead. Indeed, when I arrived, the sunset was terrific right behind the barn. But I still would have to solve the silhouette problem.\n At the time I took the two photos of the barn, above, the sunset was bright, which made the barn look completely black. Yet in the Love Lane Kitchen photos, you could see the white side of the barn and the painted flag. To get this effect, I exposed for the sunset, but then later used Capture One to selectively expose only barn and foreground much brighter. Miraculously, even though the barn originally looked completely black in my photos, the white barn and the flag were still \u0026ldquo;recoverable\u0026rdquo; in my RAW files.\nWhich picture of the barn do you like better? I think the top one is a bit more moody; I think I like it better.\nOn the way home, I passed a road sign and I liked its title, as well as the flowers and the row of American flags. I turned around and went back to get take its picture. It was getting quite dark and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a tripod. So I shot this photo with the camera sitting on the grass.\n I decided to try another one with the camera on the hood of the car. I realized the camera could see the lights of the cars on the road and went for a long exposure to blur the headlights and tailights into lines of light.\n ","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202207-mattitucksunset/","summary":"At dinner with Jacob, I enjoyed the local photos on display at the wonderful Love Lane Kitchen, on the wall just behind where we are seated.
