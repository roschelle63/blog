It was a year of branching out and our plans blossomed, so I choose the Cherry Blossoms in Georgetown as the cover theme.\n1. Washington DC: we\u0026rsquo;re here! Audrey looks to the future. In 2022, we officially added a second location in Washington DC to our life. Come visit us in Columbia Heights! (We\u0026rsquo;re there about half the year.)\n2. And we\u0026rsquo;re not happy with the Supreme Court We made signs and joined the crowds gathered at the Washington Monument to protest the (then leaked, yet unannounced) Supreme Court decision on Abortion rights. Throughout the year, Audrey engaged in Pro Bono work to contribute to the Abortion rights movement. She enjoying her job at Wilson Sonsini. Oddly, we both have offices in Washington, DC and they are a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw apart.\n3. Micah (finally) does the Lion walk Two years late, Columbia held a commencement for the Class of 2020. It was a great occasion for the family to come together and roar like a Columbia Lion in NYC. Micah is currently enjoying graduate school at Berkeley, where he is engineering integrated circuits for biotech devices.\n4. and Lucy does the Duck walk Lucy celebrated graduating from the University of Oregon, and Audrey was ever proud of her Duck! Later in the summer, Lucy moved to Los Angeles and she and Sarah now both live and work in Santa Monica, a few blocks apart from each other.\n5. Clams beware In July, the extended Roschelle family came together to celebrate Jacob\u0026rsquo;s Birthday in Mattituck, Long Island, New York. The annual clam harvest was a huge success, with over 100 clams raked up from the shallow waters.\n6. Backpacking trip to Lake Ediza In August, Micah and I had a wonderful trip to Lake Ediza \u0026ndash; continuing the annual backpacking tradition. There are lots of beautiful photos of the trip. As I mentioned, Micah is in graduate school at Berkeley \u0026ndash; which is relevant because I did this same trip to Lake Ediza when I was in graduate school at Berkeley, many moons ago.\n7. Dogs in Airports Soon enough it was September and time to head back to Washington, DC. On the way to the airport, we had a rude surprise \u0026ndash; our planned flight to Newark would not be taking dogs aboard. Audrey worked the phones quickly, and before our car even got to San Francisco, she had rebooked us for Washington, DC. Here the dogs are arriving in good health at the terminal. The ever kind cousin Eddie Goldberger was there to meet us.\n8. Audrey and the Supremes We enjoyed some great day trips around Washington DC. Here\u0026rsquo;s Audrey in Annapolis with a mural of her heros. We also enjoy the contrast with our California life \u0026ndash; where we live in DC is super walkable: should we have Pho tonight? Laos cuisine? Indian? Mexican? Malaysian? BBQ? Ethiopian? Thai? Speaking of walks, one day in Rock Creek Park we crossed paths (silently) with Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n9. Autumn Leaves It was a beautiful fall in Washington DC, and one weekend we ventured to Cacoctin Mountain, about an hour north. Lots of beautiful photos. We had beautiful leaves every weekend for about a month.\n10. Jacob calls the Rocky Mountains home Jacob graduated from Colorado College two years ago. This summer he decided to live in Denver, where he is teaching in a private high school. And skiing lots. I enjoyed visiting him in Denver, and we had a fun day hiking around Red Rocks.\n11. Retreat in Albuquerque I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying my work at Digital Promise. After two years of not seeing many people in person, our 175-person staff gathered for a retreat in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One of the most exciting things this year was that we were awarded a $20 million gift from Mackenzie Scott.\n12. Family in Washington DC Well, this final photo makes obvious why we decided to live also in Washington DC: FAMILY! Here is all of Audrey\u0026rsquo;s side of the family, enjoying a Saturday-after-Thanksgiving brunch in our house. We also had wonderful visits from my side of the family, and several trips to New Jersey (where I grew up) to boot. Our decision to split time between California and Washington DC has turned out to be a great one!\nAnd now we\u0026rsquo;re relaxing at the close of the year in California. Behind our house, Windy Hill rises to 1900 feet. From the top of Windy Hill, we sometimes get wonderful sunsets.

What we all noted after the set was how much fun the band was having, and we were having fun right along with them.\nBefore the set, I snapped this photo of the wonderous dome above us.\nWe were seated in the second pew, quite close and could really appreciate the interactions among the musicians. Julian Lage is fun to watch. He smiles a lot at his band mates. He leans into the music. And he also pauses, swinging his arm up or making another large gesture, putting space between one amazing phrase and where he wants to take the music next. The compositions alternative between jazz improvisation and very tight scripted moments, so the music expands and then suddenly contracts. The band also modulates together from loud to whisper quiet almost instantly.\nWhat impressed me the most is the vast number of contrasting textures and tones that Julian Lage under his fingers (without ever once touching a guitar pedal). He can play ridiculously fast runs very quietly. He bend single notes and make his guitar sing the blues. He accompanies himself with chords, and can land a power chord like a rock star. He uses effects like moving a wild vibrato up and down the neck. And he weaves all these textures together very musically, with dozens of textures in play in each minute of music. I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any other artist who can combine so many kinds of ideas in such a small amount of time, and yet have it all come out as natural and musical.\nAfter such a great set, the audience gave a standing ovation and called for an encore. We were treated to the classic, Blue Bayou, on Julian\u0026rsquo;s Les Paul guitar.\nBefore the Julian Lage trio, a young solo artist, Izzy Oram Brown opened the show.

Recently I took the same trip with Micah and was able to take the photo above, showing the route that accompanies the infamous tale. When I got home, I marked the route in red on the photo, with the key theoretical discussion.\nThe Story of My First Backpacking Trip As a graduate student in about 1987, I was invited on a backpacking trip by my fellow student and experienced trailblazer, Mike Sipusic. It started innocently enough with a hike from the trailhead to a campsite beside Lake Ediza, at the bottom of the red line in the photo.\nA Little Day Hike I slept well on my first night in the wilderness, and awoke excited to spend the day exploring the environs of our Lake Ediza campsite. Mike suggested off-trail adventure to the gap in the mountains at the top of the red line. Although we couldn\u0026rsquo;t scale Mount Ritter nor climb a Minaret, Mike thought we could get to the gap in the mountain and we\u0026rsquo;d be sure to see a great view out the other side.\nSo on a bright blue morning, we began our hike. First we crossed a small stream, hopping across stones. We noticed a black cloud passing overhead, but soon it disappeared and the sky was again clear and blue.\nThe View from the Top We worked our way up through a high mountain meadow, with thinning low grass. When we reached the top of the meadow, we traversed towards our goal\u0026ndash;the gap in the mountain. Then we skirted a large snow field (not shown in the photo, which was taken later in the season) We were clinbing to an elevation well over 10,000 feet, and the going was slow as we had to stop often to catch our breath. After the snow field, we realized that to get the top, we\u0026rsquo;ve have to climb over chaotic, loose slabs of fallen rock: talus. That was really slow going, as we neared the desired viewpoint.\nNot What We Expected When we got close to the top, we suddenly realized there would be no view. Instead, the black cloud was back. And it was coming our way!\nOn the Run With black cloud vapor beginning to pour over the mountain towards us, even a newbie backpacker like me realized it was time to make like a granite slab and split. We slip-slided our way back down the loose talus slope as fast as we could. When we got to the snow field, we didn\u0026rsquo;t skirt it. Instead we took big long strides through the show, going 4-5 feet down with each step. As we neared the bottom of the snow\u0026hellip;\nHail! Big, hard hailstones became to fall on us. It was painful and cold. And it was raining a hard cold rain, too. After completed the traverse, we found a boulder that was so big it made a cave underneath. We hid in the cave to wait out the hail. After 10-15 minutes, the rain and hail began to subside, and yet\u0026hellip;\nThe Theory of Lightning Now lightning began. You can\u0026rsquo;t understand the bible if you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard lightning in a mountain range. The sound defines \u0026ldquo;awesome.\u0026rdquo; This form of heavenly communication terrified our ancestors, and now I knew why. We realized we really should get out of there and started down the mountain as fast as we good. The lightning seemed to get closer, with loud CRACKS just seconds from the flashes of light. We could see lightning strikes behind us and the storm seemed to be coming our way.\nMike said: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, Jeremy, the peaks will draw the lightning strikes.\u0026rdquo;\nAt that very moment, we saw a huge flash! A bolt of lightning smote a lone tree at our campsite, thousands of feet below us.\n\u0026ldquo;There goes that theory,\u0026rdquo; I countered.\nCrossing the River We scrambled down the meadow we had climbed up earlier, but now with blue sky replaced by lightning bolts all around us. The safety of camp seemed within reach. But when we got to the little stream we had crossed in the morning, we had another surprise. It had turned into a torrent!\nThere was a fallen tree we could still walk across, but it seemed quite slim and the current was scary.\nMike jumped in the stream and braced himself on the tree. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m strong!\u0026rdquo; he offered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll help you cross.\u0026rdquo; And indeed, Mike helped our group get across the tree to the side of the river with our camp. Then, soaked, he climbed out of the raging river.\nHypothermia and Recovery Mike was starting to get hypothermia. We hustled to our camp and got his wet clothes off and dry long underwear on and got him into a sleeping bag. I got into the sleeping bag with Mike to warm him up. Gail made him a hot drink. Mike recovered. And the rest of the trip was uneventful.\nYet, the famous line and rejoinder lived on \u0026ldquo;The peaks will draw the lightning\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;there goes that theory!\u0026rdquo;\nWondering, 35 Years Later Now, revisting the same area, I wonder if we were even on the right trail. Micah found the really great view of the Minarets. It was indeed up and across a loose talus slope, but different from the one we climbed. He found the great view at a gap near Iceberg Lake. Iceberg Lake today has a well-marked trail and even a faint trail across the rock slabs.

At 9300 ft elevation, this green gem has the classic Sierra Nevada look of just four elements: bright granite, green pines, clear water and blue sky. Lake Ediza is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the Inyo National Forest, near the Mammoth Ski Area.\nAbout 35 years ago, Lake Ediza was my first backpacking trip. I was a graduate student at Berkeley then, and went with my friend and fellow student, Mike Sipusic. Now I was taking my son Micah, also a graduate student at Berkeley, on the same adventure. Well, maybe without the hail and lightning, but that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another blog.\nThis time our adventure began with a 6 hour drive east through Yosemite\u0026rsquo;s Tioga pass to Mono Lake and then south to Mammoth. From there, we boarded a shuttle to a campground in Agnew Meadows. We stayed overnight in the campground to get adjusted to the 8000 ft initial elevation and began our hike the next morning.\nDay 1: Climbing to Lake Ediza The trip began along the headwaters of California\u0026rsquo;s longest river, the San Joaquin, before climbing our first set of switchbacks to along Shadow Creek, to arrive at the beautiful Shadow Lake. From here we could spot Mt Ritter in the distance\u0026ndash;our destination.\nClick photos to enlarge. Where\u0026rsquo;s Micah? Ahead of me of course! Climbing a path through granite in the middle of a photo.\nAfter a total of 8 miles and about 4 hours of climbing, we made it to our destination. We couldn't believe the gorgeous jade color of the lake. The lake water it was pretty warm, considering that the green color comes from glacial melt. Cool down, dust off! Soon it was time for sunset.\nDay 2: Photo Paradise! We woke to beautiful reflections on the still lake. Micah prepared oatmeal breakfast with the jetboil with a gorgeous view of the Minarets at his back (note our tent below him).\nAs we began our morning-shade climb at the signpost to reach a 10,000 foot elevation, we had an amazing panorama of Lake Ediza and the twin 13,000 peaks named Ritter and Banner. After a 45 minute upwards hike, we arrived at Iceberg Lake, and evening more stunning green, and right up against the Minarets. Snow still there on Labor Day weekend! Micah climbed the haphazard pile of rocks to the left of Iceberg Lake to an even higher lake and a bigger view.\nI sauntered back down the trail, wandering off trail to get my favorite photo of the trip. The depth of the landscape and its barren, above-tree-line simplicity captures \u0026ldquo;wilderness.\u0026rdquo; I like the u-shaped glacial valley heading back to Ritter and Banner. And there\u0026rsquo;s still a glacier between the mountains!\nClick below to enlarge the pictures. They look better big! Another swim at Beach Ediza and a mystical mountain sunset ended a fine day. Day 3: Reflections I woke up early on our last day to wander the lake and take dawn reflection photos. (Click to enlarge)\nI realized I brought along two old-timers for this trip. Mike originally brought me here, and his classic Kelty pack still carries my load. And my dad Ira, engraved in Swiss red, kept us well fed by cutting some fine salami and cheese for our lunches. Over and out Soon it was time to leave. The eight miles downhill went faster of course. Micah raced ahead of me, but I was motivated to keep up: a team of four youngsters was blasting awful music as they hiked and I was desparate to stay ahead and out of earshot. When I reached the trailhead sign, Micah congratulated me on not being too far behind.\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202209-lakeediza/","summary":"This view from our campsite made every one of the 18,000 steps of the climb to Lake Ediza worth it.

I started with the acoustic jazz of George Cables and James Francies at the Stanford Jazz Workshop, then the highly amplified Afro-futurist jazz-funk of Kamasi Washington, and finally an arena show with The Chicks.

And the music did not disappoint.\nJames Francies opened the show with his trio of Zach Moses (bass) and Eric Harland (drums). The music featured powerful open chords and interesting melodies. A lot of sustained chord sounds, maybe fourths. Francies at times was technically fast and precise, but mostly very melodic and musical, with repeated cycles of chords that slowly built drama. Eric Harland played the set imaginatively, with constantly shifting beats and colors, building slowly to a climatic solo at the end of the set.\nInterestingly, Francies had been a student at the jazz workshop just seven years earlier.

I mentioned this to our server and she said \u0026ldquo;Well, tell the photographer, she\u0026rsquo;s seated right behind you!\u0026rdquo; So I did. I told her I particularly admired her sunflower photos. But I also liked the barn she shot with an American flag painted on its side.\nThe next day, Jacob and I happened to drive past the very same barn which was featured in her photos. I decided I\u0026rsquo;d head back one night to try to create a similar photo. It turned out to be hard to get the photo you see above, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get light from the sunset. Indeed, at sunset it looks like a silhouette.\nInitially I gave up and drove away. Instead, I found this other barn, just a bit down the road. The light was brighter on this one, so I snapped its picture.\nThen I decided to check out the Mattituck Inlet, about a 5 minute drive away, and just a short stroll from Love Lane (the main street of Mattituck), where Jacob and I had our delicious dinner. I snapped this photo as the sun went below the trees at the horizon.\nNearby, two young girls were jumping off a fishing boat and swimming in the salt lagoon. Just beyond the girls, an older couple was drinking wine on their boat and watching the sunset. All around me, snappers were jumping out of the water to eat their final meal of the day. I hoped they were eating lots of the gnats that were attacking me.\nAlthough the sunset was not yet over at the Inlet, the gnats were annoying, so reluctantly, I left. Next stop was the historic Hallockville Museum Farm, for this windmill.\nI wondered if I\u0026rsquo;d have time to make back to the inspirational barn, which was about 5-10 minutes away. I decided it was worth a try, especially since I noticed an odd phenomena. The sunset had already peaked on the horizon, but it was still getting better directly overhead. Indeed, when I arrived, the sunset was terrific right behind the barn. But I still would have to solve the silhouette problem.\nAt the time I took the two photos of the barn, above, the sunset was bright, which made the barn look completely black. Yet in the Love Lane Kitchen photos, you could see the white side of the barn and the painted flag. To get this effect, I exposed for the sunset, but then later used Capture One to selectively expose only barn and foreground much brighter. Miraculously, even though the barn originally looked completely black in my photos, the white barn and the flag were still \u0026ldquo;recoverable\u0026rdquo; in my RAW files.\nWhich picture of the barn do you like better? I think the top one is a bit more moody; I think I like it better.\nOn the way home, I passed a road sign and I liked its title, as well as the flowers and the row of American flags. I turned around and went back to get take its picture. It was getting quite dark and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a tripod. So I shot this photo with the camera sitting on the grass.\nI decided to try another one with the camera on the hood of the car. I realized the camera could see the lights of the cars on the road and went for a long exposure to blur the headlights and tailights into lines of light.\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202207-mattitucksunset/","summary":"At dinner with Jacob, I enjoyed the local photos on display at the wonderful Love Lane Kitchen, on the wall just behind where we are seated.

And I enjoy each of the artists individually. So I leaped at a chance go hear the pianist, Danilo Peréz lead his own group.\nThe setting could not be more beautiful. The 6th and I Synagogue is a historic building in downtown Washington DC, and its a Sephardic-style building. Rather than a long vault ending in an alter, the building is basically square, with a dome above four huge arches. The dome is pained a lovely sky blue. And the colors throughout the space are warm and inviting. I had been looking for an opportunity to show Audrey the space and it was a special bonus that Sarah was visiting us.\nThe group included Danilo on piano with cello, violin, lute and percusssion. As with his playing in Wayne Shorter\u0026rsquo;s quarter, the music emphasized flowing group improvisation rather than a traditional jazz \u0026ldquo;melody-solo-solo-solo-melody\u0026rdquo; structure. The instruments fit together beautifully and every instrumentalist was brilliant.\nThey started with their recent album, Crisálida. We learned that Charles Fishman, a VIP of DC jazz was in the house for his birthday and Danilo reached into his catalog to play a request he had not played in 30 years. The Panama cultural attaché was in the house (Danilo hails from Panama) and so he also played a familiar song, and many in the audience joined in the call-and-response singing. It was a joyous concert.\nSet List Title Composer Suite La Muralla: Rise From Love Danilo Pérez Suite La Muralla; Monopatia Danilo Pérez Expedition Danilo Pérez Adrift Danilo Pérez A Musafir Blues Danilo Pérez Seresta Paquito D’Rivera Suite La Muralla; Muroparia Danilo Pérez Details Location: 6th and I Synagogue, Washington DC Date: April 30, 2022 Attending: Jeremy, Sarah, Audrey ","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/jazz/202204-danilo/","summary":"Danilo Peréz\u0026rsquo;s Global Messengers I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of Wayne Shorter\u0026rsquo;s quartet with Danilo Peréz, John Pattituci and Brian Blade.
