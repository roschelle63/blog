After arriving on a quick two hour flight south from Lisbon, we soon found ourselves in a paradise of flowers, butterflies, steep mountain landscapes, flowing water, and adventure.\nOur first stop after picking up a rental car and checking into our hotel was to visit a lookout point, Cabo Girao. Here a skywalk juts out from a cliff, 580 meters above the ocean. The cliff drops straight down, especially as we looked through the glass floor of the skywalk. After taking in the spectacular views, we drove to a spot at sea level where a waterfall crashes down on the road; we watched some cars drive through the waterfall. Then we stopped at Porto Sol, a colorful beach town, where we enjoyed a cocktail at a cafe overlooking the ocean.\nThe next day we set out to discover more of the island, which is small. Madiera is an amazing place to drive a stick shift. It is a steep, volcanic island with deep canyons descending from the mountains to the sea. Without the amazing bridge and tunnel system, it would be impossible to get anywhere. Yet the roads are super good quality and really fun to drive on. I loved that the speed limit is marked as 90 km/h but with a sign that says you get a 10 km/h bonus if its a sunny day!\nOur day began by visiting the town of Sao Vicente, on the north side. The north side is cooler and more prone to clouds and rain. Soon we found ourselves on a beautiful beach. It was set at the end of a long valley that rose to steep, fog-shrouded mountains. As we explored a chapel atop a hill, the sun slowly illuminated up the terraced hillsides.\nWe next climbed up a narrow, winding road into the mountains. We could see the clouds flowing around the craggy peaks. As we turned north on a mountain ridge, suddenly we were surrounded by masses of yellow flowers, covering everything in sight. A high plain atop the mountains was swirling in fog, with windmills capturing the energy. Yet we had amazing views out to the coast.\nNow it was time for our first Levada walk. The rain in Madiera is captured by the peaks, but the people live and farm in valleys below. To move the water, they have a system of aqueducts built into the mountain sides. These are called \u0026ldquo;Levadas.\u0026rdquo; Most levadas have walkways following the path of the water, which means that you have very gradually climbing hikes along flowing water, often covered with flowers. We started with a top-rated Levada trail, Levada das 25 Fontes, which started below the windy mountain plain. The hike is named for the culminating waterfall, which was spectacular.\nNow I was hooked on Madiera hiking, and wanted the next day to try something really different. On the very eastern point of the island, the land pokes out into the ocean. It\u0026rsquo;s much drier and somewhat hotter, although tempered by a strong breeze. This is famous Ponta São Lourenço hike. Audrey decided to sit this one out from a perch at the trailhead, while I climbed up and down a series of reddish hills to the eastern point. It was photographically spectacular. Look for the little people clinging to the hillside—that was me! Afterwards, we went to another nearby miradoura (viewpoint) by car, and Audrey got nearly the same view without all the hiking. Unlike me, she was looking perfectly fresh!\nOur hotel was really amazing, too. We stayed at Quinta Casa Branca. A \u0026ldquo;Quinta\u0026rdquo; is an old estate. In Madeira, they converted many estates into luxury hotels. These often have expansive botantical gardens on site. Casa Branca was a L-shaped modern hotel surrounding an old banana plantation. The central area was a botanical garden. The rest of the property had a restaurant with a great daily breakfast, a pool, and the original manor house, which had also been converted to hotel rooms. We loved sitting out on lounge chairs by our room, looking out over the property.\nWe found Madiera because I was searching for festivals in Portugal, and they have a flower festival in May, which sounded attractive. During the flower festival, there is also a classic car show. On Sunday morning, there was a classic car race through the streets just below Casa Branca, in the main town of Funchal. The race was timed, which just one car going at a time. The course featured rotaries, forcing the cars to squeal their tires as they accelerated around a circle to the delight of the crowds.\nThe town of Funchal is a perfect small Portugese town, and it was decked out for the flower festival. We enjoyed every meal in Funchal. There is really a lot to do in Funchal; I can\u0026rsquo;t begin to list it all and we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to do it all. One highlight that Audrey really enjoyed was a pair of botantical gardens on the hillside.\nI loved the Levada walks so much that I went on one final hike by myself, while Audrey relaxed at the hotel pool. This one followed two different aqueducts, one on the trail going out to a waterfall and another coming back. Often I was walking on the concrete aqueduct high up on a mountain cliff, but it always felt safe. People pass on the trail by temporarily jumping from one side of the water to the other. At the farthest point, there was a waterfall which you could walk behind, and then a tunnel to get out. I followed the higher trail coming back and it led through a flower filled meadow. I took a water break in the meadow and took an \u0026ldquo;Ansel Adams\u0026rdquo; in black and white as clouds started to fill in the valley. What a great conclusion to a spectacular time in Madeira!\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/2023-madiera/","summary":"Our May 2023 visit to Madiera was a magical experience.

Driving up 280, I watched the most beautiful sunrise unfold over the East Bay hills. There was no traffic in San Francisco, so I arrived at the Golden Gate Bridge parking lot by 6:20 am and the clouds were still pink, with some sun coming in from the east.\nThe top-ranked marathoners were already across the bridge. You can see just their heads in the photo, if you look carefully.\nRoute Micah\u0026rsquo;s start time at Crissy Field was about 6:50 am. The run would take him to Fort Point, then up a steep grade to the Bridge. The top of this grade was my first lookout. Then across the Golden Gate Bridge, up and down some challenging hills near Sausilito, back again across the Bridge, and to a finish in Golden Gate Park.\nRunning North Although I was early, it was fun to join with the cheering crowd. People were holding signs and cheering on both their own runners and random ones, too. Micah texted me that he\u0026rsquo;d be there soon, and I had a tripod and a quick shutter release ready. He rounded the corner looking great. What a thrill to see Micah run with the Bridge as a backdrop.\nRunning South Next he joined the river of runners—a river that flowed for hours—to run across the pedestrian walk way on the east side of the Bridge. It\u0026rsquo;s a 3.5 mile run across the bridget and back, and the race course extended that with a hill loop on the Marin side. So I had some time to wander about and pick my next vantage point.\nMicah next texted me when he was at the near tower (746 feet high), and I was ready! Again I had the tripod and shutter release set up, and this time I took a video on my cell phone, too. The video is at the bottom of the page.\n(click any of these for bigger photos)\nAlas, Micah ran quite fast after the Bridge, and I could not make it to the finish in Golden Gate Park in time.

Leaving from our house on Town Trail, we gradually started to climb through the trees, which opened up at this familiar old corral. But today\u0026rsquo;s hike was special because the sky was amazing\u0026ndash;full of wispy, swirly clouds. When we reached the first water stop, a bench with a view in the shade, we could see the twin peaks of Windy Hill in the distance but the sky stole the show (above picture). I thought to myself: \u0026ldquo;Ollie, hope you like this kind of Sunday church service!\u0026rdquo;\nThe trail to the bench is quite steep, but after that point, it becomes more gradual. We settled into a fast yet relaxed pace for the remainder of the climb to the 1900 ft elevation of Windy Hill. We stopped for water every 30 minutes and reached the top at the 2 hour mark.\nNormally by July any flowers are dying back. But the spring was very wet, and there were still water seeps around the top of Windy Hill. Pockets of flowers were thriving. A combination of a panting dog and a very sweaty hiker led to this photo and water stop, where again we were amazed by the speckled sky.\nWe were grateful for the occasional breeze at the top of Windy Hill, cutting the heat. It was interesting to see how much vegetation they had mowed down \u0026ndash; to protect us from wildfires down below where we live. Now the trail flatten out and started downwards, and Ollie was eager to go! He was impatient as I snapped one more photo of clarkia, sticky monkey-flower, and sky \u0026ndash; and ended up in the frame.\nSo I let him off leash for the descent. A smart dog that Ollie.

Oddly, we both have offices in Washington, DC and they are a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw apart.\n3. Micah (finally) does the Lion walk Two years late, Columbia held a commencement for the Class of 2020. It was a great occasion for the family to come together and roar like a Columbia Lion in NYC. Micah is currently enjoying graduate school at Berkeley, where he is engineering integrated circuits for biotech devices.\n4. and Lucy does the Duck walk Lucy celebrated graduating from the University of Oregon, and Audrey was ever proud of her Duck! Later in the summer, Lucy moved to Los Angeles and she and Sarah now both live and work in Santa Monica, a few blocks apart from each other.\n5. Clams beware In July, the extended Roschelle family came together to celebrate Jacob\u0026rsquo;s Birthday in Mattituck, Long Island, New York. The annual clam harvest was a huge success, with over 100 clams raked up from the shallow waters.\n6.

On the way to the airport, we had a rude surprise \u0026ndash; our planned flight to Newark would not be taking dogs aboard. Audrey worked the phones quickly, and before our car even got to San Francisco, she had rebooked us for Washington, DC. Here the dogs are arriving in good health at the terminal.

Here\u0026rsquo;s Audrey in Annapolis with a mural of her heros. We also enjoy the contrast with our California life \u0026ndash; where we live in DC is super walkable: should we have Pho tonight?

Autumn Leaves It was a beautiful fall in Washington DC, and one weekend we ventured to Cacoctin Mountain, about an hour north. Lots of beautiful photos. We had beautiful leaves every weekend for about a month.\n10. Jacob calls the Rocky Mountains home Jacob graduated from Colorado College two years ago.

Retreat in Albuquerque I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying my work at Digital Promise. After two years of not seeing many people in person, our 175-person staff gathered for a retreat in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Julian Lage is fun to watch. He smiles a lot at his band mates. He leans into the music. And he also pauses, swinging his arm up or making another large gesture, putting space between one amazing phrase and where he wants to take the music next. The compositions alternative between jazz improvisation and very tight scripted moments, so the music expands and then suddenly contracts. The band also modulates together from loud to whisper quiet almost instantly.\nWhat impressed me the most is the vast number of contrasting textures and tones that Julian Lage under his fingers (without ever once touching a guitar pedal). He can play ridiculously fast runs very quietly. He bend single notes and make his guitar sing the blues. He accompanies himself with chords, and can land a power chord like a rock star. He uses effects like moving a wild vibrato up and down the neck. And he weaves all these textures together very musically, with dozens of textures in play in each minute of music. I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any other artist who can combine so many kinds of ideas in such a small amount of time, and yet have it all come out as natural and musical.\nAfter such a great set, the audience gave a standing ovation and called for an encore.

Recently I took the same trip with Micah and was able to take the photo above, showing the route that accompanies the infamous tale. When I got home, I marked the route in red on the photo, with the key theoretical discussion.\nThe Story of My First Backpacking Trip As a graduate student in about 1987, I was invited on a backpacking trip by my fellow student and experienced trailblazer, Mike Sipusic. It started innocently enough with a hike from the trailhead to a campsite beside Lake Ediza, at the bottom of the red line in the photo.\nA Little Day Hike I slept well on my first night in the wilderness, and awoke excited to spend the day exploring the environs of our Lake Ediza campsite. Mike suggested off-trail adventure to the gap in the mountains at the top of the red line. Although we couldn\u0026rsquo;t scale Mount Ritter nor climb a Minaret, Mike thought we could get to the gap in the mountain and we\u0026rsquo;d be sure to see a great view out the other side.\nSo on a bright blue morning, we began our hike. First we crossed a small stream, hopping across stones. We noticed a black cloud passing overhead, but soon it disappeared and the sky was again clear and blue.\nThe View from the Top We worked our way up through a high mountain meadow, with thinning low grass. When we reached the top of the meadow, we traversed towards our goal\u0026ndash;the gap in the mountain. Then we skirted a large snow field (not shown in the photo, which was taken later in the season) We were clinbing to an elevation well over 10,000 feet, and the going was slow as we had to stop often to catch our breath. After the snow field, we realized that to get the top, we\u0026rsquo;ve have to climb over chaotic, loose slabs of fallen rock: talus. That was really slow going, as we neared the desired viewpoint.\nNot What We Expected When we got close to the top, we suddenly realized there would be no view. Instead, the black cloud was back. And it was coming our way!\nOn the Run With black cloud vapor beginning to pour over the mountain towards us, even a newbie backpacker like me realized it was time to make like a granite slab and split. We slip-slided our way back down the loose talus slope as fast as we could. When we got to the snow field, we didn\u0026rsquo;t skirt it. Instead we took big long strides through the show, going 4-5 feet down with each step. As we neared the bottom of the snow\u0026hellip;\nHail! Big, hard hailstones became to fall on us. It was painful and cold. And it was raining a hard cold rain, too. After completed the traverse, we found a boulder that was so big it made a cave underneath. We hid in the cave to wait out the hail. After 10-15 minutes, the rain and hail began to subside, and yet\u0026hellip;\nThe Theory of Lightning Now lightning began. You can\u0026rsquo;t understand the bible if you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard lightning in a mountain range. The sound defines \u0026ldquo;awesome.\u0026rdquo; This form of heavenly communication terrified our ancestors, and now I knew why. We realized we really should get out of there and started down the mountain as fast as we good. The lightning seemed to get closer, with loud CRACKS just seconds from the flashes of light. We could see lightning strikes behind us and the storm seemed to be coming our way.\nMike said: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, Jeremy, the peaks will draw the lightning strikes.\u0026rdquo;\nAt that very moment, we saw a huge flash! A bolt of lightning smote a lone tree at our campsite, thousands of feet below us.\n\u0026ldquo;There goes that theory,\u0026rdquo; I countered.\nCrossing the River We scrambled down the meadow we had climbed up earlier, but now with blue sky replaced by lightning bolts all around us. The safety of camp seemed within reach. But when we got to the little stream we had crossed in the morning, we had another surprise. It had turned into a torrent!\nThere was a fallen tree we could still walk across, but it seemed quite slim and the current was scary.\nMike jumped in the stream and braced himself on the tree. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m strong!\u0026rdquo; he offered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll help you cross.\u0026rdquo; And indeed, Mike helped our group get across the tree to the side of the river with our camp. Then, soaked, he climbed out of the raging river.\nHypothermia and Recovery Mike was starting to get hypothermia. We hustled to our camp and got his wet clothes off and dry long underwear on and got him into a sleeping bag. I got into the sleeping bag with Mike to warm him up. Gail made him a hot drink. Mike recovered. And the rest of the trip was uneventful.\nYet, the famous line and rejoinder lived on \u0026ldquo;The peaks will draw the lightning\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;there goes that theory!\u0026rdquo;\nWondering, 35 Years Later Now, revisting the same area, I wonder if we were even on the right trail. Micah found the really great view of the Minarets. It was indeed up and across a loose talus slope, but different from the one we climbed. He found the great view at a gap near Iceberg Lake. Iceberg Lake today has a well-marked trail and even a faint trail across the rock slabs. I wonder if we were actually looking for the pass near Iceberg Lake instead try to climb to a gap in the Minarets?\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202209-35yearsago/","summary":"My first time backpacking trip, 35 years ago, featured some High Sierra drama.

At 9300 ft elevation, this green gem has the classic Sierra Nevada look of just four elements: bright granite, green pines, clear water and blue sky. Lake Ediza is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the Inyo National Forest, near the Mammoth Ski Area.\nAbout 35 years ago, Lake Ediza was my first backpacking trip. I was a graduate student at Berkeley then, and went with my friend and fellow student, Mike Sipusic. Now I was taking my son Micah, also a graduate student at Berkeley, on the same adventure. Well, maybe without the hail and lightning, but that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another blog.\nThis time our adventure began with a 6 hour drive east through Yosemite\u0026rsquo;s Tioga pass to Mono Lake and then south to Mammoth. From there, we boarded a shuttle to a campground in Agnew Meadows. We stayed overnight in the campground to get adjusted to the 8000 ft initial elevation and began our hike the next morning.\nDay 1: Climbing to Lake Ediza The trip began along the headwaters of California\u0026rsquo;s longest river, the San Joaquin, before climbing our first set of switchbacks to along Shadow Creek, to arrive at the beautiful Shadow Lake. From here we could spot Mt Ritter in the distance\u0026ndash;our destination.\nClick photos to enlarge. Where\u0026rsquo;s Micah? Ahead of me of course! Climbing a path through granite in the middle of a photo.\nAfter a total of 8 miles and about 4 hours of climbing, we made it to our destination. We couldn't believe the gorgeous jade color of the lake. The lake water it was pretty warm, considering that the green color comes from glacial melt. Cool down, dust off! Soon it was time for sunset.\nDay 2: Photo Paradise! We woke to beautiful reflections on the still lake. Micah prepared oatmeal breakfast with the jetboil with a gorgeous view of the Minarets at his back (note our tent below him).\nAs we began our morning-shade climb at the signpost to reach a 10,000 foot elevation, we had an amazing panorama of Lake Ediza and the twin 13,000 peaks named Ritter and Banner. After a 45 minute upwards hike, we arrived at Iceberg Lake, and evening more stunning green, and right up against the Minarets. Snow still there on Labor Day weekend! Micah climbed the haphazard pile of rocks to the left of Iceberg Lake to an even higher lake and a bigger view.\nI sauntered back down the trail, wandering off trail to get my favorite photo of the trip. The depth of the landscape and its barren, above-tree-line simplicity captures \u0026ldquo;wilderness.\u0026rdquo; I like the u-shaped glacial valley heading back to Ritter and Banner. And there\u0026rsquo;s still a glacier between the mountains!\nClick below to enlarge the pictures. They look better big! Another swim at Beach Ediza and a mystical mountain sunset ended a fine day. Day 3: Reflections I woke up early on our last day to wander the lake and take dawn reflection photos. (Click to enlarge)\nI realized I brought along two old-timers for this trip. Mike originally brought me here, and his classic Kelty pack still carries my load. And my dad Ira, engraved in Swiss red, kept us well fed by cutting some fine salami and cheese for our lunches. Over and out Soon it was time to leave. The eight miles downhill went faster of course. Micah raced ahead of me, but I was motivated to keep up: a team of four youngsters was blasting awful music as they hiked and I was desparate to stay ahead and out of earshot.

But I also liked the barn she shot with an American flag painted on its side.\nThe next day, Jacob and I happened to drive past the very same barn which was featured in her photos. I decided I\u0026rsquo;d head back one night to try to create a similar photo. It turned out to be hard to get the photo you see above, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get light from the sunset. Indeed, at sunset it looks like a silhouette.\nInitially I gave up and drove away. Instead, I found this other barn, just a bit down the road. The light was brighter on this one, so I snapped its picture.\nThen I decided to check out the Mattituck Inlet, about a 5 minute drive away, and just a short stroll from Love Lane (the main street of Mattituck), where Jacob and I had our delicious dinner. I snapped this photo as the sun went below the trees at the horizon.\nNearby, two young girls were jumping off a fishing boat and swimming in the salt lagoon. Just beyond the girls, an older couple was drinking wine on their boat and watching the sunset. All around me, snappers were jumping out of the water to eat their final meal of the day. I hoped they were eating lots of the gnats that were attacking me.\nAlthough the sunset was not yet over at the Inlet, the gnats were annoying, so reluctantly, I left. Next stop was the historic Hallockville Museum Farm, for this windmill.\nI wondered if I\u0026rsquo;d have time to make back to the inspirational barn, which was about 5-10 minutes away. I decided it was worth a try, especially since I noticed an odd phenomena. The sunset had already peaked on the horizon, but it was still getting better directly overhead. Indeed, when I arrived, the sunset was terrific right behind the barn. But I still would have to solve the silhouette problem.\nAt the time I took the two photos of the barn, above, the sunset was bright, which made the barn look completely black. Yet in the Love Lane Kitchen photos, you could see the white side of the barn and the painted flag. To get this effect, I exposed for the sunset, but then later used Capture One to selectively expose only barn and foreground much brighter. Miraculously, even though the barn originally looked completely black in my photos, the white barn and the flag were still \u0026ldquo;recoverable\u0026rdquo; in my RAW files.\nWhich picture of the barn do you like better? I think the top one is a bit more moody; I think I like it better.\nOn the way home, I passed a road sign and I liked its title, as well as the flowers and the row of American flags. I turned around and went back to get take its picture. It was getting quite dark and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a tripod. So I shot this photo with the camera sitting on the grass.\nI decided to try another one with the camera on the hood of the car. I realized the camera could see the lights of the cars on the road and went for a long exposure to blur the headlights and tailights into lines of light.\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202207-mattitucksunset/","summary":"At dinner with Jacob, I enjoyed the local photos on display at the wonderful Love Lane Kitchen, on the wall just behind where we are seated.
