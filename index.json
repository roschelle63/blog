Mom, Paul, and Karen flew in from New Jersey; Audrey from California; and Jacob lives and teaches in Denver. I was already there for a business trip.\nFirst stop was Colorado College, Jacob\u0026rsquo;s alma mater, pictured above. Did you know Katharine Lee Bates, an English professor at Wellesley College, composed America the Beautiful here in 1882? We asked Mom to put her Wellesley degree to work composing an update. Alas the road to Pike\u0026rsquo;s Peak was snow-covered, and thus the next verse about \u0026ldquo;purple mountain majesty\u0026rdquo; would have to await another day.\nPaul approved of Colorado College the Beautiful, but wondered a bit insistently whether Jacob might like to find a job in New York sometime soon?\nWe picked up this great mini-bus to travel in \u0026ndash; well equipped with old glass bottles of coke and snow boards. And if you believe that, I bet you\u0026rsquo;d enjoy some delicious vegan and gluten-free pastries next to the classic vinyl record shop where we parked.\nActually, we had a mundane white minivan for our travels. A recent and very generic white van with three rows of seats and power doors. No VW van for us.\nThe Garden of the Gods, also in Colorado Springs, is an amazing sight. Everyone had a walk among the towering red rocks. (Click any picture above for bigger images).

We found long vistas of wide valleys and dry mountains;lakebeds that haven\u0026rsquo;t seen water in ages; and, ghost towns with tales to tell. We crossed the Tehachapi Pass and found some Golden State dreamscapes. Here\u0026rsquo;s our trip:\nMojave Desert We first struck gold in the Mojave Desert, when we came across huge superblooms of \u0026ldquo;Desert Gold\u0026rdquo; flowers covering the sandy basin. The air was clear and the views were vast. Behind us, we could see the micro-burst storm clouds that had pelted our car with rain in the Tehachapi Pass. Ahead of us, an AirBnB awaited in sunny Ridgecrest, California.\nTammy at the the AirBnB was a wonderful host and directed us to the local Community College, which had the best hill for sunset gazing. We had flowers around us and a red glow over the mountains. Afterwards, we had great Mexican food at a friendly local dive called Olvera\u0026rsquo;s.\nTrona Pinnacles The next morning, we ventured five miles out a dirt road, crossing old mining railways. Our destination was the Trona Pinnacles, of which the Bureau of Land Management writes: \u0026ldquo;The unusual landscape consists of more than 500 tufa spires, some as high as 140 feet, rising from the bed of the Searles Dry Lake basin. The pinnacles vary in size and shape from short and squat to tall and thin, and are composed primarily of calcium carbonate (tufa). The Trona Pinnacles have been featured in many commercials, films, and still-photo shoots. The Trona Pinnacles were designated a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1968 to preserve one of North America’s most outstanding examples of tufa tower formation\u0026rdquo;\nPanamint Valley The Panamint Valley is a wide open space. Miners came here once, but an unexpected flash flood wiped out the operation in what is now called \u0026ldquo;Surprise Canyon.\u0026rdquo; We considered trading in our trusty Audi for a local pickup truck in the ghost town of Ballarat, but even the ghosts had left town. Oddly, this is a great place to watch state of the art fighter jets practice their best maneuvers, as the local \u0026ldquo;Top Guns\u0026rdquo; practice from the China Lake Naval Air Station. Why not locate a Naval Air Base in a dry lake bed?\nAs we reached the northern end of the desert valley, we found another superbloom extending as far as the eye could see.\nFurnace Creek From Panamint Junction, we climbed a pass into Death Valley proper and enjoyed a hike into Mosaic Canyon, which has narrow slot canyons. Then we checked into our hotel in Furnace Creek. You enter the hotel through a decrepit tunnel and board the single elevator car that serves the entire resort. The grounds feature a beautiful oasis with palm trees and a perfect swimming pool, but sometimes the hotel has all the ambiance of a 1950s national park hotel that was last updated in the 1920s. Our room, however, was just one of three rooms on the 4th floor and was delightful. We loved the swimming pool.\nBadwater Basin Badwater Basin is the lowest place on earth, at 282 feet below sea level. Earlier this year, it flooded due to rare atmospheric rivers passing through. Recently, people had been kayaking on the 6-mile long lake that formed from the rain waters. Kayaking was no longer allowed when we arrived, but the lake was still there. What an amazing place! We waded in an infinite expanse of lake in 90 degree heat, with snow covered Telescope Peak rising to a snow-covered 11,331 ft directly in front of us. That peak is two miles higher than where we are standing. I also liked the photo below of two people walking down a ridge towards the salt-covered lake basin. It gives a sense of scale.\nNext we hiked the Natural Bridge trail to the best natural bridge rock formation in Death Valley. Cool view! See the snow-covered mountains under the arch?\nAshford Mills and Artists Drive Then we ventured out further in Badwater Basin to an abandoned mining site called Ashford Mills, which was a good place for a picnic lunch. Purple and yellow wildflowers dotted the desert floor, leading up the colorful mountains. Notice the green colors on the mountain; that\u0026rsquo;s plants growing due to the recent rains. Overall that green is a rare sight.\nOn the way back, we checked out the otherworldly colors on the mountains at Artist\u0026rsquo;s Palette.\nViews and Springs The next day, we drove up the mountains on the east side of Death Valley. I like this shot of people hiking the \u0026ldquo;badlands\u0026rdquo; of Golden Canyon, a very popular trail. What a strange moonscape for a hike!\nLooking in a slightly different direction, I could see three layers of colorful mountains.\nNext up to Dante\u0026rsquo;s View, which overlooks Badwater Basin. I took this abstract image, which zooms down on the valley with the lake drying up in multiple colors.\nOur drive took us past a National Wildlife Preserve we never heard of, called Ash Meadows, and we took another dirt road 5 miles into the preserve. Ash Meadows is a high desert area, like the Mojave desert. Its not completely dry because there is a network of pools. The pools are fed by perfectly clear springs that rise up from the limestone below, creating a series of unique oasis spots for local \u0026ldquo;pupfish\u0026rdquo; and migrating birds.\nSunset / Sunrise We caught the sunset at the Mesquite Sand Dunes. The Mesquite also was blooming, with tiny yellow flowers. This sunset gazing spot is the single most popular attraction in Death Valley.\nAnd the next morning, I went back down to Badwater Basin to watch the sun rise.\nLeaving Death Valley; Highway 395 Finally it was time for us to leave Death Valley and its lovely 80 degree temperatures; time for a much cooler ski adventure in Lake Tahoe. The drive out from Death Valley went past Panamint Springs again, and then onto a high desert plateau covered in Joshua trees. From there we descended in the fertile Owens Valley, the site of historic California water disputes between Los Angeles and local farmers. Los Angeles won and earned the traffic gridlock to prove it.\nDeath Valley is the lowest point on earth. Nearby Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet, is the highest point in the continental US. It covered in beautiful white snow. What a contrast!\nDriving up highway 395, we stopped at the Manzanar National Historic Site. From the National Park Service: \u0026ldquo;In 1942, the United States government ordered more than 110,000 men, women, and children to leave their homes and detained them in remote, military-style camps. Manzanar War Relocation Center was one of ten camps where the US government incarcerated Japanese immigrants ineligible for citizenship and Japanese American citizens during World War II.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was very sad to visit an incarceration camp for citizens of our own country who had done nothing wrong. And it feels too possible that our country could some day again herd a portion of its own population into camps out of Xenophobic fear. The curation of the site was very well done; it told the stories of life in the camp through the eyes of those who were detained there. A visit is recommended!\nFinally, our last view before leaving the desert for Lake Tahoe. We stopped to see Mono Lake. Mono Lake has Tufa Formations as well, just like Trona Pinnacles, where we started. Those mountains are the Ansel Adams Wilderness \u0026ndash; a natural spot for a photo \u0026ndash; and a place where we\u0026rsquo;ve gone backpacking.\nIt was a fantastic trip!\nHere are all the photos.

The show was organized as a tribute to seminal jazz guitarist Jim Hall, who was a mentor to Lage. It was also somewhat of a homecoming for Lage, as he grew up in Santa Rosa. Because it was a tribute show, Lage did not play his own compositions, but instead chose Standards like:\nMy Funny Valentine Body and Soul All the Things You Are They also played a number of Jim Hall compositions, like a 16-bar blues titled \u0026ldquo;Careful.\u0026rdquo;\nJulian Lage\u0026rsquo;s talent is mesmerizing and the quartet\u0026rsquo;s take on every tune felt fresh.

Lage was well-matched here by his drummer and bass player, who were willing to go whereever the interpretation took the collective. They had an amazing groove, too. Nothing too fancy, just a great groove. The responsiveness between Chris Potter and the rhythm section was particularly wonderful, with each driving the other forward.

We had a fantastic visit. And I always love taking photos in New York, so brought my camera along.\nOur first destination was the Bowery, via the trusty 15-SBS bus. In particular, we were going to the New Museum to see their Judy Chicago exhibit. When we got off the bus, we were on Houston St right near the famous Katz\u0026rsquo;s Deli. I had to go into to see a sign I remember from my childhood \u0026ldquo;Send a salami to your boy in the army.\u0026rdquo; It was still there and the deli looked exactly the same. Need some Dr. Brown\u0026rsquo;s soda with that pastrami?\nThere is one new accomodation to the 21st century at Katz\u0026rsquo;s however. What self-respecting deli would have a neon sign for capuccino and espresso?

But we didn\u0026rsquo;t get anything to eat in either place.\nThe Bowery is had some colorful grafiti. We walked past the \u0026ldquo;Bowery Showroom.\u0026rdquo; I am not sure what was inside, but the outside was pretty wild.\nI liked this mural, too.\nWhen I was in New Mexico, I had stopped in the \u0026ldquo;Through the Flower\u0026rdquo; gallery to learn about the work of the artist Judy Chicago and her \u0026ldquo;Holocaust Project\u0026rdquo;. While in NM, the gallery staff shared that her major exhibits were in New York. Mom and I were very impressed with the New Museum which focuses on Judy Chicago\u0026rsquo;s work across four floors. The work alternates between bright and dark, explores many feminist themes, and always has a message. She\u0026rsquo;s a Jewish artist and here is the \u0026ldquo;Rainbow Shabbat,\u0026rdquo; the concluding image from her Holocaust Project.\nAfter seeing so much art, it was nice to take in the wonderful skyline view from the roof of the New Museum.\nBack near the apartment, I loved this statue outside the children\u0026rsquo;s hospital.

The retreat was held at the beautiful Tamaya Resort on land of the Santa Ana Pueblo. We came in November, and the Cottonwood trees were glowing in golden yellow along the peaceful paths throughout the resort. It is truly Tierra Grande.\nFortunately, the retreat agenda allowed for time to stroll the grounds. One evening, I found the light welcoming me on a path through the trees.\nAnd I was inspired to awake the next morning for the sunrise. I strolled down to the Rio Grande River, on the eastern edge of the resort property. A flock of geese took to the sky at dawn, dragging their feet across the still river. As the sun took to the sky, I found myself in a golden world.\nAfter the retreat, it was time for a road trip. I found this colorful beauty of pickup available alongside the road, awaiting its next reincarnation. I discovered this in a field on my way to the Salinas Pueblos Missions, about an hour south of Albuquerque.\nPer the park brochure: \u0026ldquo;The mission of San Gegrorio de Abó was founded in 1622. In 1626, the first church was completed from locally quaried red sandstone, ponderosa pine roof vigas and lintels, and finished with adobe and white gypsum plaster. Between 1626 and 1651 as a result from sucessful crop yields and trade, the population more than doubled in size bringing the number to roughly 1,400 people living at Abó. To accomodate, the second church, church of San Gregorio de Abó II was completed in 1651 and the remnants of that church is what you see today.\u0026rdquo; Then there was a drought, and the people were forced to leave for the Rio Grande valley.\nThe brochure was a bit light on the other facts of the history, for example, how the Spanish imposed upon the local workforce to build their mission churches. Separately, I read about the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, a fascinating and complex history. Bottom line: A sprawling collaboration across different Pueblos collaborated to lay seige to the Spanish, and succeeded in forcing them out of New Mexico in 1680. Freedom lasted for twelve years. In a telling detail (per the book), the Pueblo leaders left many church buildings standing, but smashed the church bells into shards.\nAfter visiting two different areas of ruins, I returned through the small town of Belen. I visited Belen to see the gallery of contemporary Jewish artist Judy Chicago. She has a fascinating personal story, featured in the gallery, of how she came to explore her own Jewish identity by touring the world and asking about the Holocaust. The gallery was created to manage the public interest in her 1977 feminist art project called The Dinner Party, which now I\u0026rsquo;d like to go see in Brooklyn.\nBelen had a lot of character. On a local recommendation, I had an amazing Chile Relleno at Pete\u0026rsquo;s before heading back to Albuquerque to meet up with my son Jacob for the next few days.\nAs it was raining in Albuquerque the next morning, Jacob and I first went for a look at the Pueblo Museum, which was an excellent introduction to history and culture. Then shifting art gears, we went to see some rock art. There are wonderful Petroglyphs just outside of Albuquerque, 400 of them to see along one 1.5 mile walk!\nIn Santa Fe, we first went to the Georgia O\u0026rsquo;Keefe Museum, a must visit! Of course, it featured her art across many periods. But the museum also shared aspects of her personal life, including a fascinating collection of recipes and canisters of ingredients from her kitchen. We were surprised to find a portrait of O\u0026rsquo;Keefe by Ansel Adams, a painting she did of Mount Fuji in Japan, and interesting examples of her artistic process.\nSanta Fe is full of character. This house was just across from the museum. We also strolled through the Plaza, the famous hotel there, and other historical sights.\nI liked the St Francis Cathedral as it has been decorated in modern times, and is very colorful. Check out the guitar player in the alter piece.\nThere is so much to do in Santa Fe! Jacob and I stayed at the atmospheric El Rey Court, went to the farmer\u0026rsquo;s market for local blue corn pupusas, met up with friends, and enjoyed the psychedelic Meow Wolf, which is a bit like playing the game of Myst. We also had two excellent dinners and found an Iconik coffee shop.\nOur highlight was undoubtably the 7 mile hike from St John\u0026rsquo;s college to the top of Atayala Mountain, a 2000 ft climb to over 9000 ft. The air was thin up there and the views were incredible. The last mile or so was really a workout up steep switchbacks.

Of course, we missed Jacob, especially when we saw the lakes full of big fat trout. Throughout the trip, we enjoyed beautiful weather. The highs were in the 70s, lows in the 50s. We looked up to brilliant blue skies. True to the idea of wilderness, we saw few people once the weekend ended (Our trip was from Sunday to Wednesday).\nWe parked at Wright\u0026rsquo;s Lake, west of Lake Tahoe and north of Highway 50. We started at 7000 feet and had only a 3 mile distance to our campsite. But it was 1600 feet up, a lot of rocky stair climbing!\nWe were rewarded: we were the only people camping at Hemlock Lake, which was one of the quietest places I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been. Also, the cover photo at the top was taken right next to our tent at Hemlock Lake.\nAfter setting up camp and recovering from the initial climb, I decided to go up another half mile to see the end of the trail, Smith Lake. Here you can see how the Desolation Wilderness got its name. It\u0026rsquo;s very rocky and crumbly. Not many meadows.\nOur permit required us to take the Smith Lake arm of the trail first, but our eventual destination was Twin Lakes, on the other arm of the trail. After a leisurely breakfast and camp breakdown, we went back down the trail. The day before I had been tired when we arrived at camp. When I saw how many steps we had climbed up the day before, I no longer felt \u0026ldquo;I must be old.\u0026rdquo;\nAt a \u0026ldquo;Y\u0026rdquo; in the trail, we switched to the Twin Lakes trail and again began to climb, but not as steeply this time. After an hour of hiking we were rewarded. Twin Lakes was a stunning playground for the gods of granite!\nMicah scampered ahead in search of a campsite near one of the two connected lakes. Meanwhile I lumbered over the hump between the lakes. When I got to the other side, I saw a campsite nestled between a boulder and tall pines, with the lake\u0026rsquo;s end to itself. I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;if I was Micah, I\u0026rsquo;d pick that campsite.\u0026rdquo; But I called out and there was no response, so I started to wrap back towards the start of the lake in search of Micah. Soon I found him. He had indeed picked that campsite, but had already gone out in search of me!\nAfter setting up our hammocks with the most amazing views of the lake and mountains, we relaxed a bit. Then I went for a stroll along the lake with my camera and discovered the flower garden. A sheltered nook in the rocky shoreline, about the size of a basketball court, must have been a bit more damp then other similar spots. It was filled with brilliant blooms of many colors from pure white to sunshine yellow and including intensive pinks and purples. And it was a butterfly garden, too!\nI noticed another fluttering creature in profusion in the garden. Like a mythical beast, it seemed to be half-moth and half-hummingbird, with a long beak, a boxy body, and rapidly beating wings that allowed it to hover. With great patience and many attempts, I got a good photo! Later at home, I identified this creature as a White-Lined Sphinx Moth, Hyles lineata.\nThis campsite, too, was very isolated from other people (although there were some other campsites in different spots of Twin Lake). The next day, we enjoyed a lazy morning. Micah didn\u0026rsquo;t wake up until 9 am. After ample breakfast and hammock time, we decided to take a day hike to the end of the trail, Island Lake.\nMicah soon spotted a mountain ridge that he wanted to summit. It\u0026rsquo;s the one at the left of the photo. Micah hikes much faster than me and he is, after all, less than half my age! So I let him enjoy his climb, while I set off in the other direction. Micah shouted out that there was snow just above me, so I went for look. So dramatic seeing the glacier-river of snow and looking up the the mountain slope! I was slowly climbing up those rocks, although it really wasn\u0026rsquo;t as hard as it may look.\nFor September, everywhere in the Desolation Wilderness surprisingly wet. There were lots of small ponds of trapped water, called \u0026ldquo;tarns.\u0026rdquo; There were many flower gardens where the ground was still damp enough, and from time to time we were traversing muddy trails or stepping on rocks to avoid lightly flooded trails. These are spring conditions, not fall conditions. Due, no doubt, to the very wet and snowy winter this year.\nFrom our camp, we could see a cascade coming down a ridge into Twin Lakes. I climbed to the top of the cascade. A group of young badass hikers were camped there, hooting and hollering as they tried to climb to the top of the pictured mountain. I enjoyed the garden of Eden near their camp in a high mountain valley (approx 8700 feet)\nThe Sierras are elemental. Granite. Water. Pine. Sky.\nIsland Lake is a perfect example. I walked down after taking this picture and met Micah at the lakeside for a lunch of crackers, olives, salami and cheese.\nThese pink flowers were everywhere on our trip, but I found them to be surprisingly hard to photograph. I finally captured a good one!\nWe got back from our day hike in the early afternoon and spent a delightful afternoon in hammocks by Twin Lake in perfect weather. No bugs to worry about, which was great.\nThat evening the sunset turned the mountains bright orange and pink as we watched the show after our dinner of freeze-dried minestrone soup and freeze-dried beef stew. The orange mountains perfectly reflected in the lake.\nAs we were watching this zen-like scene, the bozos from the top of the cascade decided they wanted to go fishing. So they climbed straight down the cascade through huge piles of slippery scree \u0026ndash; about 250 feet vertically down. Ridiculously dangerous way to go fishing. The fish showed them a cold shoulder \u0026ndash; as they were on the rockiest part of the shoreline, the bugs were elsewhere on the lake and so were the fish!\nThe next morning it was time to head home.

The minimal stage set (a low riser, draped in black, and spread with a few Indian carpets) gave few clues to the amazingly complex music soon to follow. As the musicians took their cross-legged seats, a subtle droning sound filled the room. The musicians tuned their instruments casually and settled into their places, like friends relaxing at home.\nDavies Symphony Hall is typically host to the pomp and circumstance of classical symphony orchestras\u0026ndash;but this beginning had none of that \u0026ldquo;all hail the first violin\u0026rdquo; pomposity. For this concert, the space was transformed into simple, organic space where nothing could come between the gifted musicians and their eager audience.\nThe anchors of the ensemble, tabla master Zakir Hussein and jazz guitar maestro John McLaughlin, set a spiritual tone. In flowing white hair and cottons, McLaughlin had the air of a saint. Hussein described the group\u0026rsquo;s humble beginnings in the Bay Area town of Fairfax and shared his excitement at playing for such an enthusiastic, welcoming audience. At once, he communicated a simple pleasure in making great music with his long-term friends, and yet also acknowledged that over 50 years, this unique music had a profound impact on audiences worldwide.\nI was glad my phone captured the body language of the instrumentalists, as an essence of the music was the intense communication and communion among the group members. At times, while one musician took a solo, the others would take genuine pleasure in the hearing their bandmate soar. And in accompaniment, they often clapped a sparse pattern with perhaps one clap every 5-10 seconds. The claps were not always on the same beat of the measure, but they were always in perfectly timed to land together\u0026ndash;the musicians were clearly having a ball clapping a simple, yet surprising pattern and always landing in precise synchrony.\nEach musician had their moment to demonstrate amazing virtuosity. McLaughlin at 81 years old played blazingly fast intricate lines with unparalleled precision, and yet he was also content to play soft and subtle backgrounds that set a mood for his bandmates. Hussein not only plays intense rhythms on the tabla, but also plays his drum melodically, often driving the group to greater heights (see his expression in the phone above). The three musicians who are newer to this version of Shakti\u0026ndash;Mahadevan, Selvaganesh, and Rajagopalan\u0026ndash;each also demonstrated stunning talent when it was their turn to shine.\nShakti\u0026rsquo;s music is a fusion of American jazz and traditional musical forms from India. Each musician has space to take the audience on an improvisational journey, with full interactive support of all the others on stage. Punctuating the improvisations, the group together plays rapid, precise, angular lines in unison. It\u0026rsquo;s breathtaking how they could play complex, high speed lines perfectly as one. The sound is intricate, percussive, and exciting; the group spirit is harmonious and mutually supportive; the overall themes communicated are passion and joy.\nTowards the close of the concert, there was a unexpected beautiful moment. A gentleman named Randall Kline started the SF Jazz Festival and built the SF Jazz Center, and has recently retired from his role in leading the institution. Zakir Hussein called him to the stage and presented Randall with both an Indian Sari and one of his own tabla drums.\nI was thrilled to share such an amazing concert experience with Audrey, Micah, Roy and Micah\u0026rsquo;s friend Ajay. And of course, we joined the audience at the end in a massive standing ovation.\nMembers of Shakti take a bow Details Location: Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco Date: September 9, 2023 Attending: Jeremy, Audrey, Micah, Roy, Ajay ","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/jazz/2023-09-shakti/","summary":"As the lights dimmed, members of Shakti entered the stage to a thunderous standing ovation.

For this blog. I picked just a few favorites with a story to tell. A separate photo album covers our time in Magical Madeira.\nArrival in Cascais The idea to visit Portugal began with an invitation from the Jacobs Foundation to attend a conference on the theme of how learners can adapt to our changing world. As the timing fit my 60th, Audrey and I decided to make it a birthday trip.\nThe conference was a wonderful experience. I stayed with 50 scholars in an old citadel in Cascais. The conference had a lot of time to talk and debate. And the conference agenda allowed for afternoon strolls each day. I particularly liked a cliffside walk. The cliff was punctuated by riverbeds running out to the sea, and I climbed down to a riverbed to snap this view. A path out to the sea is a great metaphoric start for a visit to Portugal.\nMeeting Audrey in Lisbon After the conference in Cascais, Audrey joined me in Lisbon. We started by hanging out on the elevated patio of our wonderful hotel, the Memmo Alfama, enjoying the extravagant view and a drink. The hotel was a treat to come home to after each day of touring.\nOften we could ride the scenic #12 or #28 tram back to the Alfama district. We were warned that the trams were pickpocket risks, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t experience issues. We rode many trams. Upon arriving back in the Alfama, we\u0026rsquo;d stroll down a quiet alley which ended at our hideaway hotel.\nFood: Modern Meets Traditional I expected to find traditional foods like sardines in Portugal, but didn\u0026rsquo;t expect all the creative adaptations of their cuisine to modern tastes and techniques. One quirky find was Miss Can, a hipster sardine bar, pictured below. Just sardines on fresh bread \u0026ndash; delicious! And it was steps away from our hotel.\nAlso near our hotel was a restaurant called Audrey\u0026rsquo;s Bistro and of course we had to eat there! We ate at everything from a Michelin two-star restaurant to the Time Out food hall to little modern cafes, and it was all delicious.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s one of too many dishes at a Michelin 2-star, with edible gold foil. Lisbon is a relatively affordable place to indulge in a long, slow, delight-filled dinner.\nJacaranda Season May was a beautiful time to visit because Lisbon was full of purple jacaranda trees in bloom. It is a delightful city for strolling, with discoveries around every corner. We had perfect temperatures, although it was sometimes a bit windy.\nGraffiti Portugal is colorful in another unexpected way: graffiti is abundant. They keep the monuments and most important places clean, but paint is abundant around railyards and abandoned buildings. And Lisbon is a city of contrasts. Much of historical Lisbon has been bought up by foreigners on Golden Visas. But there was poverty nearby, too. The graffiti is a reminder that Portugal is still undergoing massive economic transitions.\nGetting Around We really enjoyed all the forms of transportation. We took trams and buses. We rode scooters. We found Ubers to be ridiculously inexpensive. And we took trains. It was all easy to navigate.\nA few times we used the Glória Funicular, which goes up a very steep grade. At the top is a park with an amazing view. At the bottom, the best gelato! Here one upward-bound and one downward-bound funicular meet at the middle as they go up and down the hill, with people walking alongside the tracks.\nAfter a particularly delicious gelato, we considered riding this famous outdoor elevator, which goes up a hill between neighborhoods. But there was a long line, so I just snapped the photo.\nJerónimos Monastery Of touristy things in Lisbon, the Jerónimos Monastery stood out as most worthwhile. We had a heck of time getting there because there was a marathon in the streets the day we went. Trams weren\u0026rsquo;t running and we ended up in a packed bus full of runners wearing numbered cards. And there was a long line. But it was worth it.\nThe Manueline architecture is very ornate, and I took lots of photos through arches of the spires. But I especially liked a telephoto shot of a well-preserved gargoyle, a snake eating a clam.\nSintra We rode the train on a great day trip is to Sintra. Sintra is beautiful hillside where the rich built their summer palaces, about 10 miles away from the sea, perfect for catching a sea breeze.\nUpon arriving, we decided to walk into town rather than following the lemmings onto the tourist bus. We were glad we did, because we had a very quiet time in the National Palace. We took the English self-guided audio tour, and loved it. As pictured below, it really projects Portugal\u0026rsquo;s past power. Indeed, everywhere you go in Portugal there are symbols related to boats and navigation, the source of ancient power.\nThen we went up to the Moorish Castle, atop the hill. It is a thousand years old and amazingly atmospheric. We loved climbing about on the castle walls.\nThe most famous attraction, however, disappointed. The Pena Palace is a relatively modern fantasy. It had a complex ticket timing system, and we blew it, so we ended up waiting around for a long time to go inside. And in the end, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it \u0026ndash; the National Palace is a much better tour. It is colorful, however. Very instagram friendly.\nAnd after our much delayed tour of the Pena Palace we were running late for our train, so we took a Tuk Tuk on an amazingly wild ride down the mountain. We just barely made our train.\nÉvora Our other day trip was to Évora, and we had to wake up very early to catch the train. We were rewarded by a magical sunrise in Lisbon, looking up the Alfama hill where we were staying. We got to Évora in time for a little breakfast, and were horrible Americans who rushed through our coffee and croissant, much to the owner\u0026rsquo;s dismay.\nFrom Évora, we took a tour to see the ancient monoliths (a bit like Stonehenge), and that tour was really interesting. But the big surprise was happening upon a harvest in a cork forest. The tour guide stopped the van and we all watched cork being expertly peeled from a tree and loaded on a truck.\nWe also toured around Évora, but our guide was disappointing. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice place to learn about the awfulness of the Inquisition. But overall, not a must see. And from Lisbon, it\u0026rsquo;s quite a long day trip. Although we were exhausted when we got back to our hotel in Lisbon, the hotel was featuring a private Fado concert that night. The wonderful music ended being another highlight of the trip.\nJewish Tour Extraordinaire Audrey saved the best for last. She found and booked a Jewish walking tour. There isn\u0026rsquo;t actually that much Jewish history to see in Lisbon. Yet Professor Paolo Scheffer was the most amazing tour guide ever. He is a historian and an activist for preservation of historical places and artifacts. We learned about 600 years worth of Portugese Jewish history and every moment was fascinating. There are proud moments, and tragic moments. Stupid moments, and small victories. Conspiracy theories and little known massacres. Myths debunked and new history in the making. It was supposed to last 3 hours but went on for at least 5 hours. We didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice the time going by.\nAnd it is always delightful to stroll in Lisbon. I took so many photos of narrow streets like this one in Barrio Alto..\nLooking back on the photos, we enjoyed a tremendous variety of fun experiences all centered on Lisbon. People were friendly, everything was easy to do, and there were so many great choices for each day. Of course, any trip is only good as the person you are with. I was glad to be with my beautiful wife Audrey.\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/2023-portugalstories/","summary":"In May 2023, we returned from Portugal with over 400 photos.

Anat Cohen—a favorite at the Stanford Jazz Festival every year—plays a soulful clarinet. She joined Romero on the precise, fast runs but also led with intricate melodies and soaring solos.

After arriving on a quick two hour flight south from Lisbon, we soon found ourselves in a paradise of flowers, butterflies, steep mountain landscapes, flowing water, and adventure.\nOur first stop after picking up a rental car and checking into our hotel was to visit a lookout point, Cabo Girao. Here a skywalk juts out from a cliff, 580 meters above the ocean. The cliff drops straight down, especially as we looked through the glass floor of the skywalk. After taking in the spectacular views, we drove to a spot at sea level where a waterfall crashes down on the road; we watched some cars drive through the waterfall. Then we stopped at Porto Sol, a colorful beach town, where we enjoyed a cocktail at a cafe overlooking the ocean.\nThe next day we set out to discover more of the island, which is small. Madeira is an amazing place to drive a stick shift. It is a steep, volcanic island with deep canyons descending from the mountains to the sea. Without the amazing bridge and tunnel system, it would be impossible to get anywhere. Yet the roads are super good quality and really fun to drive on. I loved that the speed limit is marked as 90 km/h but with a sign that says you get a 10 km/h bonus if its a sunny day!\nOur day began by visiting the town of Sao Vicente, on the north side. The north side is cooler and more prone to clouds and rain. Soon we found ourselves on a beautiful beach. It was set at the end of a long valley that rose to steep, fog-shrouded mountains. As we explored a chapel atop a hill, the sun slowly illuminated up the terraced hillsides.\nWe next climbed up a narrow, winding road into the mountains. We could see the clouds flowing around the craggy peaks. As we turned north on a mountain ridge, suddenly we were surrounded by masses of yellow flowers, covering everything in sight. A high plain atop the mountains was swirling in fog, with windmills capturing the energy. Yet we had amazing views out to the coast.\nNow it was time for our first Levada walk. The rain in Madeira is captured by the peaks, but the people live and farm in valleys below. To move the water, they have a system of aqueducts built into the mountain sides. These are called \u0026ldquo;Levadas.\u0026rdquo; Most levadas have walkways following the path of the water, which means that you have very gradually climbing hikes along flowing water, often covered with flowers. We started with a top-rated Levada trail, Levada das 25 Fontes, which started below the windy mountain plain. The hike is named for the culminating waterfall, which was spectacular.\nNow I was hooked on Madeira hiking, and wanted the next day to try something really different. On the very eastern point of the island, the land pokes out into the ocean. It\u0026rsquo;s much drier and somewhat hotter, although tempered by a strong breeze. This is famous Ponta São Lourenço hike. Audrey decided to sit this one out from a perch at the trailhead, while I climbed up and down a series of reddish hills to the eastern point. It was photographically spectacular. Look for the little people clinging to the hillside—that was me! Afterwards, we went to another nearby miradoura (viewpoint) by car, and Audrey got nearly the same view without all the hiking. Unlike me, she was looking perfectly fresh!\nOur hotel was really amazing, too. We stayed at Quinta Casa Branca. A \u0026ldquo;Quinta\u0026rdquo; is an old estate. In Madeira, they converted many estates into luxury hotels. These often have expansive botantical gardens on site. Casa Branca was a L-shaped modern hotel surrounding an old banana plantation. The central area was a botanical garden. The rest of the property had a restaurant with a great daily breakfast, a pool, and the original manor house, which had also been converted to hotel rooms. We loved sitting out on lounge chairs by our room, looking out over the property.\nWe found Madeira because I was searching for festivals in Portugal, and they have a flower festival in May, which sounded attractive. During the flower festival, there is also a classic car show. On Sunday morning, there was a classic car race through the streets just below Casa Branca, in the main town of Funchal. The race was timed, which just one car going at a time. The course featured rotaries, forcing the cars to squeal their tires as they accelerated around a circle to the delight of the crowds.\nThe town of Funchal is a perfect small Portugese town, and it was decked out for the flower festival. We enjoyed every meal in Funchal. There is really a lot to do in Funchal; I can\u0026rsquo;t begin to list it all and we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to do it all. One highlight that Audrey really enjoyed was a pair of botantical gardens on the hillside.\nI loved the Levada walks so much that I went on one final hike by myself, while Audrey relaxed at the hotel pool. This one followed two different aqueducts, one on the trail going out to a waterfall and another coming back. Often I was walking on the concrete aqueduct high up on a mountain cliff, but it always felt safe. People pass on the trail by temporarily jumping from one side of the water to the other. At the farthest point, there was a waterfall which you could walk behind, and then a tunnel to get out. I followed the higher trail coming back and it led through a flower filled meadow. I took a water break in the meadow and took an \u0026ldquo;Ansel Adams\u0026rdquo; in black and white as clouds started to fill in the valley. What a great conclusion to a spectacular time in Madeira!\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/2023-madiera/","summary":"Our May 2023 visit to Madeira was a magical experience.

Driving up 280, I watched the most beautiful sunrise unfold over the East Bay hills. There was no traffic in San Francisco, so I arrived at the Golden Gate Bridge parking lot by 6:20 am and the clouds were still pink, with some sun coming in from the east.\nThe top-ranked marathoners were already across the bridge. You can see just their heads in the photo, if you look carefully.\nRoute Micah\u0026rsquo;s start time at Crissy Field was about 6:50 am. The run would take him to Fort Point, then up a steep grade to the Bridge. The top of this grade was my first lookout. Then across the Golden Gate Bridge, up and down some challenging hills near Sausilito, back again across the Bridge, and to a finish in Golden Gate Park.\nRunning North Although I was early, it was fun to join with the cheering crowd. People were holding signs and cheering on both their own runners and random ones, too. Micah texted me that he\u0026rsquo;d be there soon, and I had a tripod and a quick shutter release ready. He rounded the corner looking great.

Leaving from our house on Town Trail, we gradually started to climb through the trees, which opened up at this familiar old corral. But today\u0026rsquo;s hike was special because the sky was amazing\u0026ndash;full of wispy, swirly clouds. When we reached the first water stop, a bench with a view in the shade, we could see the twin peaks of Windy Hill in the distance but the sky stole the show (above picture). I thought to myself: \u0026ldquo;Ollie, hope you like this kind of Sunday church service!\u0026rdquo;\nThe trail to the bench is quite steep, but after that point, it becomes more gradual. We settled into a fast yet relaxed pace for the remainder of the climb to the 1900 ft elevation of Windy Hill. We stopped for water every 30 minutes and reached the top at the 2 hour mark.\nNormally by July any flowers are dying back. But the spring was very wet, and there were still water seeps around the top of Windy Hill. Pockets of flowers were thriving. A combination of a panting dog and a very sweaty hiker led to this photo and water stop, where again we were amazed by the speckled sky.\nWe were grateful for the occasional breeze at the top of Windy Hill, cutting the heat.

Backpacking trip to Lake Ediza In August, Micah and I had a wonderful trip to Lake Ediza \u0026ndash; continuing the annual backpacking tradition. There are lots of beautiful photos of the trip. As I mentioned, Micah is in graduate school at Berkeley \u0026ndash; which is relevant because I did this same trip to Lake Ediza when I was in graduate school at Berkeley, many moons ago.\n7. Dogs in Airports Soon enough it was September and time to head back to Washington, DC. On the way to the airport, we had a rude surprise \u0026ndash; our planned flight to Newark would not be taking dogs aboard. Audrey worked the phones quickly, and before our car even got to San Francisco, she had rebooked us for Washington, DC. Here the dogs are arriving in good health at the terminal. The ever kind cousin Eddie Goldberger was there to meet us.\n8. Audrey and the Supremes We enjoyed some great day trips around Washington DC. Here\u0026rsquo;s Audrey in Annapolis with a mural of her heros. We also enjoy the contrast with our California life \u0026ndash; where we live in DC is super walkable: should we have Pho tonight? Laos cuisine? Indian? Mexican? Malaysian? BBQ? Ethiopian? Thai? Speaking of walks, one day in Rock Creek Park we crossed paths (silently) with Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n9. Autumn Leaves It was a beautiful fall in Washington DC, and one weekend we ventured to Cacoctin Mountain, about an hour north. Lots of beautiful photos. We had beautiful leaves every weekend for about a month.\n10. Jacob calls the Rocky Mountains home Jacob graduated from Colorado College two years ago. This summer he decided to live in Denver, where he is teaching in a private high school. And skiing lots. I enjoyed visiting him in Denver, and we had a fun day hiking around Red Rocks.\n11. Retreat in Albuquerque I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying my work at Digital Promise. After two years of not seeing many people in person, our 175-person staff gathered for a retreat in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One of the most exciting things this year was that we were awarded a $20 million gift from Mackenzie Scott.\n12. Family in Washington DC Well, this final photo makes obvious why we decided to live also in Washington DC: FAMILY! Here is all of Audrey\u0026rsquo;s side of the family, enjoying a Saturday-after-Thanksgiving brunch in our house. We also had wonderful visits from my side of the family, and several trips to New Jersey (where I grew up) to boot. Our decision to split time between California and Washington DC has turned out to be a great one!\nAnd now we\u0026rsquo;re relaxing at the close of the year in California. Behind our house, Windy Hill rises to 1900 feet. From the top of Windy Hill, we sometimes get wonderful sunsets.

What we all noted after the set was how much fun the band was having, and we were having fun right along with them.\nBefore the set, I snapped this photo of the wonderous dome above us.\nWe were seated in the second pew, quite close and could really appreciate the interactions among the musicians. Julian Lage is fun to watch. He smiles a lot at his band mates. He leans into the music. And he also pauses, swinging his arm up or making another large gesture, putting space between one amazing phrase and where he wants to take the music next. The compositions alternative between jazz improvisation and very tight scripted moments, so the music expands and then suddenly contracts. The band also modulates together from loud to whisper quiet almost instantly.\nWhat impressed me the most is the vast number of contrasting textures and tones that Julian Lage under his fingers (without ever once touching a guitar pedal). He can play ridiculously fast runs very quietly. He bend single notes and make his guitar sing the blues. He accompanies himself with chords, and can land a power chord like a rock star. He uses effects like moving a wild vibrato up and down the neck. And he weaves all these textures together very musically, with dozens of textures in play in each minute of music. I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any other artist who can combine so many kinds of ideas in such a small amount of time, and yet have it all come out as natural and musical.\nAfter such a great set, the audience gave a standing ovation and called for an encore. We were treated to the classic, Blue Bayou, on Julian\u0026rsquo;s Les Paul guitar.\nBefore the Julian Lage trio, a young solo artist, Izzy Oram Brown opened the show.

Recently I took the same trip with Micah and was able to take the photo above, showing the route that accompanies the infamous tale. When I got home, I marked the route in red on the photo, with the key theoretical discussion.\nThe Story of My First Backpacking Trip As a graduate student in about 1987, I was invited on a backpacking trip by my fellow student and experienced trailblazer, Mike Sipusic. It started innocently enough with a hike from the trailhead to a campsite beside Lake Ediza, at the bottom of the red line in the photo.\nA Little Day Hike I slept well on my first night in the wilderness, and awoke excited to spend the day exploring the environs of our Lake Ediza campsite. Mike suggested off-trail adventure to the gap in the mountains at the top of the red line. Although we couldn\u0026rsquo;t scale Mount Ritter nor climb a Minaret, Mike thought we could get to the gap in the mountain and we\u0026rsquo;d be sure to see a great view out the other side.\nSo on a bright blue morning, we began our hike. First we crossed a small stream, hopping across stones. We noticed a black cloud passing overhead, but soon it disappeared and the sky was again clear and blue.\nThe View from the Top We worked our way up through a high mountain meadow, with thinning low grass. When we reached the top of the meadow, we traversed towards our goal\u0026ndash;the gap in the mountain. Then we skirted a large snow field (not shown in the photo, which was taken later in the season) We were clinbing to an elevation well over 10,000 feet, and the going was slow as we had to stop often to catch our breath. After the snow field, we realized that to get the top, we\u0026rsquo;ve have to climb over chaotic, loose slabs of fallen rock: talus. That was really slow going, as we neared the desired viewpoint.\nNot What We Expected When we got close to the top, we suddenly realized there would be no view. Instead, the black cloud was back. And it was coming our way!\nOn the Run With black cloud vapor beginning to pour over the mountain towards us, even a newbie backpacker like me realized it was time to make like a granite slab and split. We slip-slided our way back down the loose talus slope as fast as we could. When we got to the snow field, we didn\u0026rsquo;t skirt it. Instead we took big long strides through the show, going 4-5 feet down with each step. As we neared the bottom of the snow\u0026hellip;\nHail! Big, hard hailstones became to fall on us. It was painful and cold. And it was raining a hard cold rain, too. After completed the traverse, we found a boulder that was so big it made a cave underneath. We hid in the cave to wait out the hail. After 10-15 minutes, the rain and hail began to subside, and yet\u0026hellip;\nThe Theory of Lightning Now lightning began. You can\u0026rsquo;t understand the bible if you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard lightning in a mountain range. The sound defines \u0026ldquo;awesome.\u0026rdquo; This form of heavenly communication terrified our ancestors, and now I knew why. We realized we really should get out of there and started down the mountain as fast as we good. The lightning seemed to get closer, with loud CRACKS just seconds from the flashes of light. We could see lightning strikes behind us and the storm seemed to be coming our way.\nMike said: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, Jeremy, the peaks will draw the lightning strikes.\u0026rdquo;\nAt that very moment, we saw a huge flash! A bolt of lightning smote a lone tree at our campsite, thousands of feet below us.\n\u0026ldquo;There goes that theory,\u0026rdquo; I countered.\nCrossing the River We scrambled down the meadow we had climbed up earlier, but now with blue sky replaced by lightning bolts all around us. The safety of camp seemed within reach. But when we got to the little stream we had crossed in the morning, we had another surprise. It had turned into a torrent!\nThere was a fallen tree we could still walk across, but it seemed quite slim and the current was scary.\nMike jumped in the stream and braced himself on the tree. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m strong!\u0026rdquo; he offered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll help you cross.\u0026rdquo; And indeed, Mike helped our group get across the tree to the side of the river with our camp. Then, soaked, he climbed out of the raging river.\nHypothermia and Recovery Mike was starting to get hypothermia. We hustled to our camp and got his wet clothes off and dry long underwear on and got him into a sleeping bag. I got into the sleeping bag with Mike to warm him up. Gail made him a hot drink. Mike recovered. And the rest of the trip was uneventful.\nYet, the famous line and rejoinder lived on \u0026ldquo;The peaks will draw the lightning\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;there goes that theory!\u0026rdquo;\nWondering, 35 Years Later Now, revisting the same area, I wonder if we were even on the right trail. Micah found the really great view of the Minarets. It was indeed up and across a loose talus slope, but different from the one we climbed. He found the great view at a gap near Iceberg Lake. Iceberg Lake today has a well-marked trail and even a faint trail across the rock slabs. I wonder if we were actually looking for the pass near Iceberg Lake instead try to climb to a gap in the Minarets?\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202209-35yearsago/","summary":"My first time backpacking trip, 35 years ago, featured some High Sierra drama.

We stayed overnight in the campground to get adjusted to the 8000 ft initial elevation and began our hike the next morning.\nDay 1: Climbing to Lake Ediza The trip began along the headwaters of California\u0026rsquo;s longest river, the San Joaquin, before climbing our first set of switchbacks to along Shadow Creek, to arrive at the beautiful Shadow Lake.

Soon it was time for sunset.\nDay 2: Photo Paradise! We woke to beautiful reflections on the still lake. Micah prepared oatmeal breakfast with the jetboil with a gorgeous view of the Minarets at his back (note our tent below him).\nAs we began our morning-shade climb at the signpost to reach a 10,000 foot elevation, we had an amazing panorama of Lake Ediza and the twin 13,000 peaks named Ritter and Banner. After a 45 minute upwards hike, we arrived at Iceberg Lake, and evening more stunning green, and right up against the Minarets. Snow still there on Labor Day weekend! Micah climbed the haphazard pile of rocks to the left of Iceberg Lake to an even higher lake and a bigger view.\nI sauntered back down the trail, wandering off trail to get my favorite photo of the trip. The depth of the landscape and its barren, above-tree-line simplicity captures \u0026ldquo;wilderness.\u0026rdquo; I like the u-shaped glacial valley heading back to Ritter and Banner. And there\u0026rsquo;s still a glacier between the mountains!\nClick below to enlarge the pictures. They look better big! Another swim at Beach Ediza and a mystical mountain sunset ended a fine day. Day 3: Reflections I woke up early on our last day to wander the lake and take dawn reflection photos. (Click to enlarge)\nI realized I brought along two old-timers for this trip. Mike originally brought me here, and his classic Kelty pack still carries my load. And my dad Ira, engraved in Swiss red, kept us well fed by cutting some fine salami and cheese for our lunches. Over and out Soon it was time to leave. The eight miles downhill went faster of course. Micah raced ahead of me, but I was motivated to keep up: a team of four youngsters was blasting awful music as they hiked and I was desparate to stay ahead and out of earshot. When I reached the trailhead sign, Micah congratulated me on not being too far behind.\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202209-lakeediza/","summary":"This view from our campsite made every one of the 18,000 steps of the climb to Lake Ediza worth it.

I started with the acoustic jazz of George Cables and James Francies at the Stanford Jazz Workshop, then the highly amplified Afro-futurist jazz-funk of Kamasi Washington, and finally an arena show with The Chicks. The Chicks show was a lot of fun, with hordes of screaming female fans, some cute kids all around us, and overall high spirits. But it takes an hour to get in and out of parking and the quality of the sound system really didn\u0026rsquo;t do justice to how talented the Chicks are. Kamasi in a small club venue was amazingly powerful, the sound system was awesome, the hassle factor was zero and we could get as close as we wanted to the musicians. And as clear in the Stanford Workshop show, with jazz, you can get up close and personal with the greatest musicians in jazz with no hassle at all.

And the music did not disappoint.\nJames Francies opened the show with his trio of Zach Moses (bass) and Eric Harland (drums). The music featured powerful open chords and interesting melodies. A lot of sustained chord sounds, maybe fourths. Francies at times was technically fast and precise, but mostly very melodic and musical, with repeated cycles of chords that slowly built drama. Eric Harland played the set imaginatively, with constantly shifting beats and colors, building slowly to a climatic solo at the end of the set.\nInterestingly, Francies had been a student at the jazz workshop just seven years earlier. And he studied with George Cables.\nAfter the break, George Cables slowly came on stage, using a walker with yellow tennis balls at the bottom.

I mentioned this to our server and she said \u0026ldquo;Well, tell the photographer, she\u0026rsquo;s seated right behind you!\u0026rdquo; So I did. I told her I particularly admired her sunflower photos. But I also liked the barn she shot with an American flag painted on its side.\nThe next day, Jacob and I happened to drive past the very same barn which was featured in her photos. I decided I\u0026rsquo;d head back one night to try to create a similar photo. It turned out to be hard to get the photo you see above, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get light from the sunset. Indeed, at sunset it looks like a silhouette.\nInitially I gave up and drove away. Instead, I found this other barn, just a bit down the road. The light was brighter on this one, so I snapped its picture.\nThen I decided to check out the Mattituck Inlet, about a 5 minute drive away, and just a short stroll from Love Lane (the main street of Mattituck), where Jacob and I had our delicious dinner. I snapped this photo as the sun went below the trees at the horizon.\nNearby, two young girls were jumping off a fishing boat and swimming in the salt lagoon. Just beyond the girls, an older couple was drinking wine on their boat and watching the sunset. All around me, snappers were jumping out of the water to eat their final meal of the day. I hoped they were eating lots of the gnats that were attacking me.\nAlthough the sunset was not yet over at the Inlet, the gnats were annoying, so reluctantly, I left. Next stop was the historic Hallockville Museum Farm, for this windmill.\nI wondered if I\u0026rsquo;d have time to make back to the inspirational barn, which was about 5-10 minutes away. I decided it was worth a try, especially since I noticed an odd phenomena. The sunset had already peaked on the horizon, but it was still getting better directly overhead. Indeed, when I arrived, the sunset was terrific right behind the barn. But I still would have to solve the silhouette problem.\nAt the time I took the two photos of the barn, above, the sunset was bright, which made the barn look completely black. Yet in the Love Lane Kitchen photos, you could see the white side of the barn and the painted flag. To get this effect, I exposed for the sunset, but then later used Capture One to selectively expose only barn and foreground much brighter. Miraculously, even though the barn originally looked completely black in my photos, the white barn and the flag were still \u0026ldquo;recoverable\u0026rdquo; in my RAW files.\nWhich picture of the barn do you like better? I think the top one is a bit more moody; I think I like it better.\nOn the way home, I passed a road sign and I liked its title, as well as the flowers and the row of American flags. I turned around and went back to get take its picture. It was getting quite dark and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a tripod. So I shot this photo with the camera sitting on the grass.\nI decided to try another one with the camera on the hood of the car. I realized the camera could see the lights of the cars on the road and went for a long exposure to blur the headlights and tailights into lines of light.\n","permalink":"https://jeremyr.blog/posts/photos/202207-mattitucksunset/","summary":"At dinner with Jacob, I enjoyed the local photos on display at the wonderful Love Lane Kitchen, on the wall just behind where we are seated.
