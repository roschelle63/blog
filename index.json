Here are some personal favorites:\n  Handbook chapter providing a broad overview of what we know about technology for learning mathematics Roschelle, J., Noss, R., Blikstein, P., \u0026amp; Jackiw, N.

DOI\n  CV and Biosketches I don\u0026rsquo;t typically keep my CV up to date, but here is a recent NSF biosketch and IES biosketch.\nPatents It seems cool that my name is on a few patents. As far as I know, these patents have never been used for anything. The history was that my former employer, SRI International, pursued and was awarded these patents based on research conducted in our Center for Technology in Learning on the topic of computer-supported collaborative learning, especially with mobile devices. As is typical, the patents are assigned to SRI; I don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; any rights in them.\n6,628,918 Roschelle, Vahey, De Frondeville (2003) System, method and computer program product for instant group learning feedback via image-based marking and aggregation.\n6885844 Roschelle \u0026amp; Digiano (2005).

Singer Frank Lacy gave an impassioned, powerful rendition of the story about saxophonist Lester Young, who married a white woman, and found \u0026ldquo;love is never easy street.\u0026rdquo; Scott Robinson started the tune with an amazing unaccompanied sax solo\nCharles McPherson In a surprise, one of Mingus\u0026rsquo;s original bandmates joined the concert. Charles McPherson is well into his 80s and it was wonderful to watch the reactions of the seated bandmembers as he took his first solo \u0026ndash; they were blown away!\nFables of Faubus McPherson gave a great intro to this Mingus protest song, about the governor of Arkansas in the civil rights era.
