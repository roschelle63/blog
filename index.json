The instruments fit together beautifully and every instrumentalist was brilliant.\nThey started with their recent album, Crisálida. We learned that Charles Fishman, a VIP of DC jazz was in the house for his birthday and Danilo reached into his catalog to play a request he had not played in 30 years.
