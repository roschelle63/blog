<meta name="description" content="My camera and I went to pay tribute to Matthew Brady, the famous photographer of the Civil War.

The cemetery has many former members of Congress, soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War and Civil War and more. It also has a lot of dogs. You see, those congresspeople didn&rsquo;t allocate funding for the upkeep of their graves.
