      <description>Black and white photos bring out the character of Madison&amp;rsquo;s east side. From our apartment in the &amp;ldquo;The Medallion,&amp;rdquo; we hear at least one freighter blast its horn each day as a train bearing grain or other commodities on its crawl along the lakeshore. Across the street, Madison Gas &amp;amp; Electric rises with impressive smokestacks and an eclectic mix of historic brick and modern steel buildings. Its a very clean power plant.</description>

      <description>Hitting the trail Our quest for the perfect lake in California&amp;rsquo;s Sierra Nevada continued this year with backpacking in the Desolation Wilderness. This year Micah Jacob and I were joined by a special guest: nephew Jack. We planned a four day trip:
From the Wright Lake trailhead to Maude Lake Then over the Rockbound Pass at nearly 9000 feet, to Lake Schmidell A day hike, return to camp at Lake Schmidell Return 9 miles to Wright Lake Day One: To Maude Lake We left chilly, foggy San Francisco at about 9:30 am and arrived at Wright Lake for a lunch of fresh Indian dips, procured from the Noe Valley Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market.</description>

      <description>In July, the fields of Wisconsin are filled with flowers. We&amp;rsquo;re delighted to have Lucy visiting with us from LA. Last night we watched fireworks all around Lake Monona. Today we went to a dog park and had a great hike among these lovely flowers.

      <title>Dog Park @ Prairie Moraine</title>

      <description>Today, we discovered what a &amp;ldquo;dog park&amp;rdquo; means in Wisconsin. Prairie Moraine is an 80 acre area where dogs can roam off-leash. There were nice, wide hiking trails covered in soft bark (so not muddy). The countryside was rolling, as is most of Wisconsin. Ollie and Sugar Baby loved the freedom to follow their noses, and I found many flowers to photograph. There are many dog parks around Madison; this one was 20 minutes away.</description>

      <description>Today I had a nice visit to the Olbrich Botanical Garden in Madison. I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a pass for the city bikes, and I picked up an electric bike nearby. It was a nice 15 minute ride along the Capital Bike Path, which went adjacent to extensive community gardens.
The botanical garden has 16 acres of land, and is planted in sections with varying themes. One area was a Thai garden, and it has a Thai temple but this was closed for repairs.</description>

      <description>A hot tip led us to Madison&amp;rsquo;s Yahara River for the annual Fools&amp;rsquo; Flotilla. This boat parade flowed down the river between Madison&amp;rsquo;s two lakes on a beautiful Sunday morning. The end destination was the Marquette Neighborhood Associationâ€™s Waterfront Festival. Good zany fun.

      <description>In May 2024, our family converged in the mile-high city of Denver for a beautiful spring weekend. Mom, Paul, and Karen flew in from New Jersey; Audrey from California; and Jacob lives and teaches in Denver. I was already there for a business trip.
First stop was Colorado College, Jacob&amp;rsquo;s alma mater, pictured above. Did you know Katharine Lee Bates, an English professor at Wellesley College, composed America the Beautiful here in 1882?</description>

      <description>The spring rains and cool weather yielded the most abundant flowers I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen in Edgewood Park, near Redwood City. I hiked the Serpentine Loop. Serpentine is a California rock formation that has the beneficial property of killing non-native grasses, and thereby allowing the local wildflowers to thrive. It&amp;rsquo;s a greenish rock.
In my first photo, of the poppies on the rock, note the lizard. Redwood City was so-named because it was a port from which redwoods were shipped.</description>

      <description>We went out looking for life in Death Valley. We found long vistas of wide valleys and dry mountains;lakebeds that haven&amp;rsquo;t seen water in ages; and, ghost towns with tales to tell. We crossed the Tehachapi Pass and found some Golden State dreamscapes. Here&amp;rsquo;s our trip:
Mojave Desert We first struck gold in the Mojave Desert, when we came across huge superblooms of &amp;ldquo;Desert Gold&amp;rdquo; flowers covering the sandy basin. The air was clear and the views were vast.</description>

      <description>Upon arriving in Vancouver for the AAAI Conference, I took a photo walk and water taxi to False Creek. In two hours it was misty, then sunny, then it hailed, then sunny, then gale force winds. Welcome to Vancouver! There is a wonderful public market on Granville Island, and I found smoked salmon, some rice paper rolls, and a little soup for lunch. Granville Island was an industrial area and became an art gallery area, perhaps best illustrated by the &amp;ldquo;Giants&amp;rdquo; painted onto cement towers.</description>

      <description>For Martin Luther King weekend, I drove up to NYC to see Mom &amp;amp; Paul. We had a fantastic visit. And I always love taking photos in New York, so brought my camera along.
Our first destination was the Bowery, via the trusty 15-SBS bus. In particular, we were going to the New Museum to see their Judy Chicago exhibit. When we got off the bus, we were on Houston St right near the famous Katz&amp;rsquo;s Deli.</description>

      <description>On their first night in DC, I took Micah and Victoria for a walk around the Tidal Basin at night. It was a warm, calm evening. Perfect for a winter walk. And Thomas Jefferson was glad we visited.
Martin Luther King seemed to have a few things to say to the Washington Monument. While Micah and Victoria read all the MLK quotes, I set up my tripod for some clear night shots.</description>

      <description>On a sunny Saturday morning in December, we took the dogs for a stroll in Old Town Alexandria, about 25 minutes from our house. We enjoyed all the colonial-era houses, many with tasteful decorations. Sugar Baby and Ollie enjoyed the walk but reported better odds of finding dropped food on the ground near our house.

      <description>I came to New Mexico for a Digital Promise retreat, and stayed for an adventure with my son, Jacob. The retreat was held at the beautiful Tamaya Resort on land of the Santa Ana Pueblo. We came in November, and the Cottonwood trees were glowing in golden yellow along the peaceful paths throughout the resort. It is truly Tierra Grande.
Fortunately, the retreat agenda allowed for time to stroll the grounds.</description>

      <description>Following our annual tradition, Micah and I had a fantastic father-son backpacking trip in California&amp;rsquo;s Sierra Nevada. Of course, we missed Jacob, especially when we saw the lakes full of big fat trout. Throughout the trip, we enjoyed beautiful weather. The highs were in the 70s, lows in the 50s. We looked up to brilliant blue skies. True to the idea of wilderness, we saw few people once the weekend ended (Our trip was from Sunday to Wednesday).</description>

      <description>In May 2023, we returned from Portugal with over 400 photos. For this blog. I picked just a few favorites with a story to tell. A separate photo album covers our time in Magical Madeira.
Arrival in Cascais The idea to visit Portugal began with an invitation from the Jacobs Foundation to attend a conference on the theme of how learners can adapt to our changing world. As the timing fit my 60th, Audrey and I decided to make it a birthday trip.</description>

      <description>Our May 2023 visit to Madeira was a magical experience. After arriving on a quick two hour flight south from Lisbon, we soon found ourselves in a paradise of flowers, butterflies, steep mountain landscapes, flowing water, and adventure.
Our first stop after picking up a rental car and checking into our hotel was to visit a lookout point, Cabo Girao. Here a skywalk juts out from a cliff, 580 meters above the ocean.</description>

      <description>To see Micah run the San Francisco Half Marathon, I arose at 5:30 am. Driving up 280, I watched the most beautiful sunrise unfold over the East Bay hills. There was no traffic in San Francisco, so I arrived at the Golden Gate Bridge parking lot by 6:20 am and the clouds were still pink, with some sun coming in from the east.
The top-ranked marathoners were already across the bridge.</description>

      <description>On a warm July Sunday, Ollie and I set out to climb Windy Hill with no particular expectations. Leaving from our house on Town Trail, we gradually started to climb through the trees, which opened up at this familiar old corral. But today&amp;rsquo;s hike was special because the sky was amazing&amp;ndash;full of wispy, swirly clouds. When we reached the first water stop, a bench with a view in the shade, we could see the twin peaks of Windy Hill in the distance but the sky stole the show (above picture).</description>

      <description>One of my favorite spots on the North Fork of Long Island is the historic seaport of Greenport, established 1838. From Mattituck, it&amp;rsquo;s a 20 minute drive through vineyards, farmstands and the small towns of Cutchogue and Southold. As a boy, I always loved visiting Preston&amp;rsquo;s Marine Supply, a real boating and sailing supply shop.
On this visit to Greenport, I was attracted to the rusty old shipyard. At first I saw the shop buildings and wandered over.</description>

      <description>Peak cherry blossoms were waiting for us when we arrived this year in Washington, DC. After a few days of rain, we awoke to a glorious Sunday morning. Audrey and I hopped on the city bikes (with helmets, of course), and rode 30 minutes to the National Mall. We were greeted by peak crowds, all trying to get to Tidal Basin that surrounds the Jefferson Memorial.
Hundreds of crossing guards were out to guide the throngs.</description>

      <description>In twelve photos, I reflect on 2022. It was a year of branching out and our plans blossomed, so I choose the Cherry Blossoms in Georgetown as the cover theme.
1. Washington DC: we&amp;rsquo;re here! Audrey looks to the future. In 2022, we officially added a second location in Washington DC to our life. Come visit us in Columbia Heights! (We&amp;rsquo;re there about half the year.)
2. And we&amp;rsquo;re not happy with the Supreme Court We made signs and joined the crowds gathered at the Washington Monument to protest the (then leaked, yet unannounced) Supreme Court decision on Abortion rights.</description>

      <description>I recently enjoyed a few days at Asilomar, near Monterey, California, while attending a NSF conference on Artificial Intelligence. The air was sparkling clear and fresh. Early the first morning I wandered down to the beach to watch the first rays of sun hit the sand.
Waves crashing on the rocks. Walking down to the beach. A lone seagull on the mirrored beach. The winding path back to the conference center.</description>

      <description>As the culmination of a great family visit with Amy, Len, Isla and Jack, we toured the Washington Monument. We were blessed with a very clear day and great views in every direction. After passing through security (some guy failed to get through with a large purple scissors), we were whisked 90 seconds up in an elevator to the top.

      <description>Fall is breaking out all over, and no where better then nearby Rock Creek Park. We love that Beach Dr is closed to cars; its the perfect weekend stroll. And because of the absense of cars anywhere nearby, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to experience complete quiet even though we&amp;rsquo;re in middle of DC.
A couple of weekends ago, we were walking here and Audrey spotted Justice Sonia Sotomayor walking by. A DC moment!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re really enjoying autumn in DC&amp;ndash;and so are Sugar Baby, Ollie, and Lola, who have gotten their humans to take them on many fun day trips. This time we ventured a little to Cacoctin Mountain Park in Maryland north of DC. (Pronounced &amp;ldquo;Ka-Kock-tin&amp;rdquo;).
A little over an hour of driving brought us to the beginning of our hike. The sky was a bit gray and the temperatures in the 60s. Ollie was especially excited and pulling hard on his leash.</description>

      <description>On a beautiful sunny fall day, Audrey, Carolyn and I ventured to Annapolis with Ollie, Sugar Baby and Lola. What&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful outing without three dogs? The dogs were especially delighted when we immediately came upon a Dog Treat Parlor on Main Street&amp;ndash;fresh biscuits for all!
Annapolis has a great collection of colonial architecture from different eras. At the visitor center we picked up a walking tour guide. The visitor center was on such a colorful street!</description>

      <description>On a beautiful fall day, I ventured to Great Falls National Park, just outside of Washington, DC. The air was clear, dry and just a little warm in the sun. Sugar Baby and Ollie came for the ride, and were delighted with the number of dogs at the park and the quality of the resulting smells.
Aside from three easy overlooks, the trails in the park mostly follow the cliff above the river.</description>

      <description>Devil&amp;rsquo;s Postpile National Monument is a natural wonder. It features tall columns of basalt. And they twist and bend in impossible contortions. A short hike a way brought us to 100=foot tall Rainbow Falls.
Micah and I visited the day before starting our backpacking trip. It was convenient, as there was a shuttle from our campsite to the Monument, including both destinations.</description>

      <description>My first time backpacking trip, 35 years ago, featured some High Sierra drama. Recently I took the same trip with Micah and was able to take the photo above, showing the route that accompanies the infamous tale. When I got home, I marked the route in red on the photo, with the key theoretical discussion.
The Story of My First Backpacking Trip As a graduate student in about 1987, I was invited on a backpacking trip by my fellow student and experienced trailblazer, Mike Sipusic.</description>

      <description>What would a backpacking trip to the Ansel Adams Wilderness be without black and white photos? Two lakes are featured, Ediza and Iceberg. John Muir called the Sierra Nevada The Range of Light. Here&amp;rsquo;s an original photo by Ansel of the same location.

      <title>Backpacking to Lake Ediza</title>

      <description>This view from our campsite made every one of the 18,000 steps of the climb to Lake Ediza worth it. At 9300 ft elevation, this green gem has the classic Sierra Nevada look of just four elements: bright granite, green pines, clear water and blue sky. Lake Ediza is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the Inyo National Forest, near the Mammoth Ski Area.
About 35 years ago, Lake Ediza was my first backpacking trip.</description>

      <description>Ollie and I hiked a 3.5 hour loop to the top of Windy Hill and back. I love that we have such an amazing hike right from our front door. There was a cool breeze from the fog at the coast, but we had sunshine all the way. A perfect day for the hike!
When I first moved to California, my landlady informed me that the appearance of Amaryllis Belladonna (first flower picture) means &amp;ldquo;Back to School.</description>

      <description>At dinner with Jacob, I enjoyed the local photos on display at the wonderful Love Lane Kitchen, on the wall just behind where we are seated. I mentioned this to our server and she said &amp;ldquo;Well, tell the photographer, she&amp;rsquo;s seated right behind you!&amp;rdquo; So I did. I told her I particularly admired her sunflower photos. But I also liked the barn she shot with an American flag painted on its side.</description>

      <description>Tradition continued in &amp;lsquo;22 with a great family clam dig in Peconic Bay. Would there be few clams this year? Only big chowder clams? Or a bonanza?
Around 11 am the first rakes hit the water. We were in luck! Just 20 feet from the water&amp;rsquo;s edge we quickly found beds of nice sized clams. Everyone took turns with the clam rakes, dragging through the water until you hit a bump, digging, and scooping up the clams.</description>

      <title>Micah&#39;s Delayed Commencement</title>

      <description>The Roschelle family happily converged at Morningside Heights to celebrate Micah&amp;rsquo;s commencement from Columbia University. He actually graduated two years ago, in May 2020. But that was the year of coming home for spring break and never returning to New York to finish senior year. So it was great to finally have a full on celebration two years later. My mother, Alice, has a master&amp;rsquo;s degree from Columbia, making it a multi-generational roar of the Columbia lion.</description>

      <description>Audrey and I created some impromptu posters, hopped on the #54 bus, and joined the Washington DC Women&amp;rsquo;s March. We were protesting the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s draft decision to overturn Roe v Wade. Lots of people asked to take a photo of Audrey&amp;rsquo;s poster: &amp;ldquo;if men could get pregnant, abortions would be available at ATMs.&amp;rdquo;
The weather was misty, but warm, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t mind getting wet. The rally started on a lawn just below the Washington Monument.</description>

      <description>Union station in Washington DC is one of the most beautiful train stations in the United States. One afternoon, I had a great time wandering about and shooting photos.
The station is fun for people watching, although some people appear frozen in stone.</description>

      <description>On a beautiful morning, we decided to visit the National Zoo. Alas the only panda we saw was a statue at the entrance! Mom tried to play with the seals, but they were more interested in the 5 and 6 year old kids running about.
My favorite photo is the goat in a bucket!
We got to the zoo by Lyft. As you may know, the National Zoo is on a hill.</description>

      <description>About a year ago, the dogs and I enjoyed a beautiful day on a California beach. Lola loves fetching a ball along the waterline. Ollie loves playing keep away with the ball. Both can run and run and run at the beach.
I was looking for some photos to print and found these three shots. I really enjoyed looking back on them. I hope you do, too.</description>

      <title>April in Georgetown, a stroll</title>

      <description>Late in the afternoon on Easter Sunday, I wandered through the streets of Georgetown, in Washington DC. It was very quiet. I love how actively people plan beautiful little displays of flowers in Washington DC, especially tulips at this time of year. Many houses have lamps which are lit with actual gas, not electricity. I also wondered along the historical canal that goes a hundred miles or so into Maryland. I&amp;rsquo;ve really been enjoying the long spring &amp;ndash; we started with spring in California in mid-January and now continuing it in DC well into mid-April.</description>

      <description>We had a beautiful sunny day for my birthday. Jacob and I rode bikes to the National Mall, and visited the Tidal Basin. The Cherry Blossoms were well past their peak but still beautiful. As we were leaving the Tidal Basin, we came upon this monumental tulip collection.</description>

      <description>On a lovely spring Sunday, we took Lola, Ollie and Sugar Baby for a walk at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. It felt very spacious and quiet. Trees were blooming everywhere. We were surprised to find huge columns, which were moved here from the Capitol when it was expanded. The dogs loved their walk and so did we.</description>

      <description>We were lucky to be in Washington DC for the cherry blossoms. We decided to take a morning off from work and picked the perfect sunny morning. It was so festive: lots of people taking photos in fancy dresses, people dancing, and everyone just having a great time!</description>
