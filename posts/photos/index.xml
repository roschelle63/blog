      <description>In May 2023, we returned from Portugal with over 400 photos. For this blog. I picked just a few favorites with a story to tell. A separate photo album covers our time in Magical Madeira.
Arrival in Cascais The idea to visit Portugal began with an invitation from the Jacobs Foundation to attend a conference on the theme of how learners can adapt to our changing world. As the timing fit my 60th, Audrey and I decided to make it a birthday trip.</description>

      <description>Our May 2023 visit to Madiera was a magical experience. After arriving on a quick two hour flight south from Lisbon, we soon found ourselves in a paradise of flowers, butterflies, steep mountain landscapes, flowing water, and adventure.
Our first stop after picking up a rental car and checking into our hotel was to visit a lookout point, Cabo Girao. Here a skywalk juts out from a cliff, 580 meters above the ocean.</description>

      <description>To see Micah run the San Francisco Half Marathon, I arose at 5:30 am. Driving up 280, I watched the most beautiful sunrise unfold over the East Bay hills. There was no traffic in San Francisco, so I arrived at the Golden Gate Bridge parking lot by 6:20 am and the clouds were still pink, with some sun coming in from the east.
The top-ranked marathoners were already across the bridge.</description>

      <title>Hiking Windy Hill with Ollie</title>

      <description>On a warm July Sunday, Ollie and I set out to climb Windy Hill with no particular expectations. Leaving from our house on Town Trail, we gradually started to climb through the trees, which opened up at this familiar old corral. But today&amp;rsquo;s hike was special because the sky was amazing&amp;ndash;full of wispy, swirly clouds. When we reached the first water stop, a bench with a view in the shade, we could see the twin peaks of Windy Hill in the distance but the sky stole the show (above picture).</description>

      <description>One of my favorite spots on the North Fork of Long Island is the historic seaport of Greenport, established 1838. From Mattituck, it&amp;rsquo;s a 20 minute drive through vineyards, farmstands and the small towns of Cutchogue and Southold. As a boy, I always loved visiting Preston&amp;rsquo;s Marine Supply, a real boating and sailing supply shop.
On this visit to Greenport, I was attracted to the rusty old shipyard. At first I saw the shop buildings and wandered over.</description>

      <description>Peak cherry blossoms were waiting for us when we arrived this year in Washington, DC. After a few days of rain, we awoke to a glorious Sunday morning. Audrey and I hopped on the city bikes (with helmets, of course), and rode 30 minutes to the National Mall. We were greeted by peak crowds, all trying to get to Tidal Basin that surrounds the Jefferson Memorial.
Hundreds of crossing guards were out to guide the throngs.</description>

      <description>In twelve photos, I reflect on 2022. It was a year of branching out and our plans blossomed, so I choose the Cherry Blossoms in Georgetown as the cover theme.
1. Washington DC: we&amp;rsquo;re here! Audrey looks to the future. In 2022, we officially added a second location in Washington DC to our life. Come visit us in Columbia Heights! (We&amp;rsquo;re there about half the year.)
2. And we&amp;rsquo;re not happy with the Supreme Court We made signs and joined the crowds gathered at the Washington Monument to protest the (then leaked, yet unannounced) Supreme Court decision on Abortion rights.</description>

      <description>I recently enjoyed a few days at Asilomar, near Monterey, California, while attending a NSF conference on Artificial Intelligence. The air was sparkling clear and fresh. Early the first morning I wandered down to the beach to watch the first rays of sun hit the sand.
Waves crashing on the rocks. Walking down to the beach. A lone seagull on the mirrored beach. The winding path back to the conference center.</description>

      <description>As the culmination of a great family visit with Amy, Len, Isla and Jack, we toured the Washington Monument. We were blessed with a very clear day and great views in every direction. After passing through security (some guy failed to get through with a large purple scissors), we were whisked 90 seconds up in an elevator to the top.

      <description>Fall is breaking out all over, and no where better then nearby Rock Creek Park. We love that Beach Dr is closed to cars; its the perfect weekend stroll. And because of the absense of cars anywhere nearby, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to experience complete quiet even though we&amp;rsquo;re in middle of DC.
A couple of weekends ago, we were walking here and Audrey spotted Justice Sonia Sotomayor walking by. A DC moment!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re really enjoying autumn in DC&amp;ndash;and so are Sugar Baby, Ollie, and Lola, who have gotten their humans to take them on many fun day trips. This time we ventured a little to Cacoctin Mountain Park in Maryland north of DC. (Pronounced &amp;ldquo;Ka-Kock-tin&amp;rdquo;).
A little over an hour of driving brought us to the beginning of our hike. The sky was a bit gray and the temperatures in the 60s. Ollie was especially excited and pulling hard on his leash.</description>

      <description>On a beautiful sunny fall day, Audrey, Carolyn and I ventured to Annapolis with Ollie, Sugar Baby and Lola. What&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful outing without three dogs? The dogs were especially delighted when we immediately came upon a Dog Treat Parlor on Main Street&amp;ndash;fresh biscuits for all!
Annapolis has a great collection of colonial architecture from different eras. At the visitor center we picked up a walking tour guide. The visitor center was on such a colorful street!</description>

      <description>On a beautiful fall day, I ventured to Great Falls National Park, just outside of Washington, DC. The air was clear, dry and just a little warm in the sun. Sugar Baby and Ollie came for the ride, and were delighted with the number of dogs at the park and the quality of the resulting smells.
Aside from three easy overlooks, the trails in the park mostly follow the cliff above the river.</description>

      <description>Devil&amp;rsquo;s Postpile National Monument is a natural wonder. It features tall columns of basalt. And they twist and bend in impossible contortions. A short hike a way brought us to 100=foot tall Rainbow Falls.
Micah and I visited the day before starting our backpacking trip. It was convenient, as there was a shuttle from our campsite to the Monument, including both destinations.</description>

      <description>My first time backpacking trip, 35 years ago, featured some High Sierra drama. Recently I took the same trip with Micah and was able to take the photo above, showing the route that accompanies the infamous tale. When I got home, I marked the route in red on the photo, with the key theoretical discussion.
The Story of My First Backpacking Trip As a graduate student in about 1987, I was invited on a backpacking trip by my fellow student and experienced trailblazer, Mike Sipusic.</description>

      <description>What would a backpacking trip to the Ansel Adams Wilderness be without black and white photos? Two lakes are featured, Ediza and Iceberg. John Muir called the Sierra Nevada The Range of Light. Here&amp;rsquo;s an original photo by Ansel of the same location.

      <description>This view from our campsite made every one of the 18,000 steps of the climb to Lake Ediza worth it. At 9300 ft elevation, this green gem has the classic Sierra Nevada look of just four elements: bright granite, green pines, clear water and blue sky. Lake Ediza is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the Inyo National Forest, near the Mammoth Ski Area.
About 35 years ago, Lake Ediza was my first backpacking trip.</description>

      <description>Ollie and I hiked a 3.5 hour loop to the top of Windy Hill and back. I love that we have such an amazing hike right from our front door. There was a cool breeze from the fog at the coast, but we had sunshine all the way. A perfect day for the hike!
When I first moved to California, my landlady informed me that the appearance of Amaryllis Belladonna (first flower picture) means &amp;ldquo;Back to School.</description>

      <description>At dinner with Jacob, I enjoyed the local photos on display at the wonderful Love Lane Kitchen, on the wall just behind where we are seated. I mentioned this to our server and she said &amp;ldquo;Well, tell the photographer, she&amp;rsquo;s seated right behind you!&amp;rdquo; So I did. I told her I particularly admired her sunflower photos. But I also liked the barn she shot with an American flag painted on its side.</description>

      <description>Tradition continued in &amp;lsquo;22 with a great family clam dig in Peconic Bay. Would there be few clams this year? Only big chowder clams? Or a bonanza?
Around 11 am the first rakes hit the water. We were in luck! Just 20 feet from the water&amp;rsquo;s edge we quickly found beds of nice sized clams. Everyone took turns with the clam rakes, dragging through the water until you hit a bump, digging, and scooping up the clams.</description>

      <description>The Roschelle family happily converged at Morningside Heights to celebrate Micah&amp;rsquo;s commencement from Columbia University. He actually graduated two years ago, in May 2020. But that was the year of coming home for spring break and never returning to New York to finish senior year. So it was great to finally have a full on celebration two years later. My mother, Alice, has a master&amp;rsquo;s degree from Columbia, making it a multi-generational roar of the Columbia lion.</description>

      <description>Audrey and I created some impromptu posters, hopped on the #54 bus, and joined the Washington DC Women&amp;rsquo;s March. We were protesting the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s draft decision to overturn Roe v Wade. Lots of people asked to take a photo of Audrey&amp;rsquo;s poster: &amp;ldquo;if men could get pregnant, abortions would be available at ATMs.&amp;rdquo;
The weather was misty, but warm, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t mind getting wet. The rally started on a lawn just below the Washington Monument.</description>

      <description>On a beautiful morning, we decided to visit the National Zoo. Alas the only panda we saw was a statue at the entrance! Mom tried to play with the seals, but they were more interested in the 5 and 6 year old kids running about.
My favorite photo is the goat in a bucket!
We got to the zoo by Lyft. As you may know, the National Zoo is on a hill.</description>

I was looking for some photos to print and found these three shots. I really enjoyed looking back on them. I hope you do, too.</description>

      <description>Late in the afternoon on Easter Sunday, I wandered through the streets of Georgetown, in Washington DC. It was very quiet. I love how actively people plan beautiful little displays of flowers in Washington DC, especially tulips at this time of year. Many houses have lamps which are lit with actual gas, not electricity. I also wondered along the historical canal that goes a hundred miles or so into Maryland. I&amp;rsquo;ve really been enjoying the long spring &amp;ndash; we started with spring in California in mid-January and now continuing it in DC well into mid-April.</description>

      <description>On a lovely spring Sunday, we took Lola, Ollie and Sugar Baby for a walk at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. It felt very spacious and quiet. Trees were blooming everywhere. We were surprised to find huge columns, which were moved here from the Capitol when it was expanded. The dogs loved their walk and so did we.</description>
