      <title>Backpacking to Lake Ediza</title>

      <description>This view from our campsite made every one of the 18,000 steps of the climb to Lake Ediza worth it. At 9300 ft elevation, this green gem has the classic Sierra Nevada look of just four elements: bright granite, green pines, clear water and blue sky. Lake Ediza is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the Inyo National Forest, near the Mammoth Ski Area.
About 35 years ago, Lake Ediza was my first backpacking trip.</description>

      <description>Ollie and I hiked a 3.5 hour loop to the top of Windy Hill and back. I love that we have such an amazing hike right from our front door. There was a cool breeze from the fog at the coast, but we had sunshine all the way. A perfect day for the hike!
When I first moved to California, my landlady informed me that the appearance of Amaryllis Belladonna (first flower picture) means &amp;ldquo;Back to School.</description>

      <description>At dinner with Jacob, I enjoyed the local photos on display at the wonderful Love Lane Kitchen, on the wall just behind where we are seated. I mentioned this to our server and she said &amp;ldquo;Well, tell the photographer, she&amp;rsquo;s seated right behind you!&amp;rdquo; So I did. I told her I particularly admired her sunflower photos. But I also liked the barn she shot with an American flag painted on its side.</description>

      <description>Tradition continued in &amp;lsquo;22 with a great family clam dig in Peconic Bay. Would there be few clams this year? Only big chowder clams? Or a bonanza?
Around 11 am the first rakes hit the water. We were in luck! Just 20 feet from the water&amp;rsquo;s edge we quickly found beds of nice sized clams. Everyone took turns with the clam rakes, dragging through the water until you hit a bump, digging, and scooping up the clams.</description>

      <title>Micah&#39;s Delayed Commencement</title>

      <description>The Roschelle family happily converged at Morningside Heights to celebrate Micah&amp;rsquo;s commencement from Columbia University. He actually graduated two years ago, in May 2020. But that was the year of coming home for spring break and never returning to New York to finish senior year. So it was great to finally have a full on celebration two years later. My mother, Alice, has a master&amp;rsquo;s degree from Columbia, making it a multi-generational roar of the Columbia lion.</description>

      <description>Audrey and I created some impromptu posters, hopped on the #54 bus, and joined the Washington DC Women&amp;rsquo;s March. We were protesting the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s draft decision to overturn Roe v Wade. Lots of people asked to take a photo of Audrey&amp;rsquo;s poster: &amp;ldquo;if men could get pregnant, abortions would be available at ATMs.&amp;rdquo;
 The weather was misty, but warm, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t mind getting wet. The rally started on a lawn just below the Washington Monument.</description>

      <description>Union station in Washington DC is one of the most beautiful train stations in the United States. One afternoon, I had a great time wandering about and shooting photos.
 The station is fun for people watching, although some people appear frozen in stone.

      <title>Visiting the National Zoo with Mom</title>

      <description>On a beautiful morning, we decided to visit the National Zoo. Alas the only panda we saw was a statue at the entrance! Mom tried to play with the seals, but they were more interested in the 5 and 6 year old kids running about.
My favorite photo is the goat in a bucket!
We got to the zoo by Lyft. As you may know, the National Zoo is on a hill.</description>

      <description>About a year ago, the dogs and I enjoyed a beautiful day on a California beach. Lola loves fetching a ball along the waterline. Ollie loves playing keep away with the ball. Both can run and run and run at the beach.
  I was looking for some photos to print and found these three shots. I really enjoyed looking back on them. I hope you do, too.

      <title>April in Georgetown, a stroll</title>

      <description>Late in the afternoon on Easter Sunday, I wandered through the streets of Georgetown, in Washington DC. It was very quiet. I love how actively people plan beautiful little displays of flowers in Washington DC, especially tulips at this time of year. Many houses have lamps which are lit with actual gas, not electricity. I also wondered along the historical canal that goes a hundred miles or so into Maryland. I&amp;rsquo;ve really been enjoying the long spring &amp;ndash; we started with spring in California in mid-January and now continuing it in DC well into mid-April.</description>

      <description>We had a beautiful sunny day for my birthday. Jacob and I rode bikes to the National Mall, and visited the Tidal Basin. The Cherry Blossoms were well past their peak but still beautiful. As we were leaving the Tidal Basin, we came upon this monumental tulip collection.

      <description>On a lovely spring Sunday, we took Lola, Ollie and Sugar Baby for a walk at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. It felt very spacious and quiet. Trees were blooming everywhere. We were surprised to find huge columns, which were moved here from the Capitol when it was expanded. The dogs loved their walk and so did we.

      <description>We were lucky to be in Washington DC for the cherry blossoms. We decided to take a morning off from work and picked the perfect sunny morning. It was so festive: lots of people taking photos in fancy dresses, people dancing, and everyone just having a great time!
