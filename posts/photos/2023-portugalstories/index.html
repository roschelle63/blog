  "articleBody": "In May 2023, we returned from Portugal with over 400 photos. Here I pick just a few favorites, choosing photos with a story to tell. A separate photo album covers our time in Magical Madiera.\nArrival in Cascais The idea to visit Portugal began with an invitation from the Jacobs Foundation to attend a conference on the theme of how learners can adapt to changing world. As the timing fit my 60th birthday, Audrey and I decided to make it a birthday trip.\nThe conference was a wonderful experience. I stayed with 50 scholars in an old citadel in Cascais that had been converted to a fancy hotel. The conference had a lot of time to talk and debate. And the conference agenda allowed for afternoon strolls each day; I particularly liked a cliffside walk to the south. The cliff was punctuated by dry riverbeds running out to the sea, and I climbed down to a riverbed to snap this view out to the sea. A path out to the sea is a metaphoric start for a visit to Portugal.\nMeeting Audrey in Lisbon After the conference in Cascais, Audrey met me in Lisbon. As she had just flown in, we started by hanging out on the elevated patio of our wonderful hotel, the Memmo Alfama, enjoying the extravagant view. The hotel was a treat to come home to after each day of touring.\nOften we could ride the scenic #12 or #28 tram back to the Alfama district. We were wanred that the trams were pickpocket risks, but we didn’t have any issues. We rode many trams. Upon arriving back in the Alfama, we’d stroll down a quiet alley which ended at our hideway hotel.\nFood: Modern Meets Traditional I expected to find traditional foods like Sardines in Portugal, but didn’t expect all the creative adaptations of their cuisine to modern tastes and techniques. One quirky find was Miss Can, a hipster sardine bar, pictured below. Just sardines on fresh bread – delicious! And it was just steps away from our hotel.\nAlso near our hotel was a restaurant called Audrey’s Bistro and of course we had to eat there! We ate at everything from a Michelin two-star restaurant to the Time Out food hall to little modern and traditional cafes, and it was all delicious.\nHere’s one of too many dishes at a Michelin 2-star, featuring edible gold foil. Lisbon is a relatively affordable place to check out a Michelin-starred restaurant.\nJacaranda Season May was a beautiful time to visit, and especially because Lisbon was full of purple jacaranda trees in bloom. It is a delightful city for strolling, with discoveries around every corner. We had perfect temperatures, although it was sometimes a bit windy.\nGraffiti Portugal is colorful in another unexpected way: graffiti is abundant. They keep the monuments and most important places clean, but everything else is covered in paint. And Lisbon is a city of contrasts. Much of historical Lisbon has been bought up by foreigners on Golden Visas. But then again, there are some extremely poor sections, like Alfama, which still have local residents. The graffiti is a reminder that Portugal is still undergoing massive economic transitions.\nGetting Around We really enjoyed all the forms of transportation. We took trams and buses, as well as the famous funicular pictured here. We rode scooters. We found Ubers to be ridiculously inexpensive. And we took trains. It was all easy to navigate.\nA few times we used the Glória Funicular, which goes up a very steep grade. At the top is a park with an amazing view. At the bottom, the best gelato! Here one upward-bound and one downward-bound funicular meet at the middle as they go up and down the hill, with people walking alongside the tracks.\nAfter a particularly delicious gelato, we considered riding this famous elevator, which goes up a hill between neighborhood. But there was a long line, so I just got the photo.\nJerónimos Monastery Of touristy things in Lisbon, the Jerónimos Monastery stood out as most worth doing. We had a heck of time getting there because there was a marathon in the streets the day we went. Trams weren’t running and we ended up in a packed bus full of runners wearing numbered cards. And there was a long line. But it was worth it.\nThe Manueline architecture is very ornate, and I took lots of photos through arches of the spires. But I especially liked a telephoto shot of a well-preserved gargoyle, a snake eating a clam.\nSintra A great day trip is to Sintra; we took the train there. Sintra is beautiful hillside where the rich built their summer palaces, about 10 miles away from the sea, so as to catch the perfect breezes.\nUpon arriving, we decided to walk into town rather than following the lemmings onto the tourist bus. We were glad we did, because we had a very quiet time in the National Palace. We took the English self-guided audio tour, and loved it. As pictured below, it really projects Portugal’s past power. Indeed, everywhere you go in Portugal there are symbols related to boats and navigation, the source of ancient power.\nThen we went up to the Moorish Castle, atop the hill. It is a thousand years old and amazingly atmospheric. We loved climbing about on the castle walls.\nThe most famous attraction, however, disappointed. The Pena Palace is a relatively modern fantasy. It had a complex ticket timing system, and we blew it, so we ended up waiting around for a long time to go inside. And in the end, it wasn’t worth it – the National Palace is a much better tour. It is colorful, however. Very instagram friendly.\nAnd after our much delayed tour of the Pena Palace we were running late for our train, so we took a Tuk Tuk on an amazingly wild ride down the mountain. We just barely made our train.\nÉvora Our other day trip was to Évora, and we had to wake up very early to catch the train. We were rewarded by a magical sunrise in Lisbon, looking up the Alfama hill where we were staying. We got to Évora in time for a little breakfast, and were horrible Americans who rushed through our coffee and croissant, much to the owner’s dismay.\nFrom Évora, we took a tour to see the ancient monoliths (a bit like Stonehenge), and that tour was really interesting. But the big surprise was happening upon a harvest in a cork forest. The tour guide stopped the van and we all watched cork being expertly peeled from a tree and loaded on a truck.\nWe also toured around Évora, but our guide was disappointing. It’s a nice place to learn about the Inquisition. And a nice small walled town. But overall, not a must see. And from Lisbon, it’s quite a long day trip. Although we were exhausted when we got back to our hotel in Lisbon, the hotel was featuring a private Fado concert that night. The wonderufl music ended being another highlight of the trip.\nJewish Tour Extraordinaire Audrey saved the best for last. She found and booked a Jewish walking tour. There isn’t actually that much Jewish history to see in Lisbon. Yet Professor Paolo Scheffer was the most amazing tour guide ever. He is a historian and an activist for preservation of historical places and artifacts. We learned about 600 years worth of Portugese Jewish history and every moment was fascinating. There are proud moments, and tragic moments. Stupid moments, and small victories. Conspiracy theories and little known massacres. Myths debunked and new history in the making. It was supposed to last 3 hours but went on for at least 5 hours. We didn’t even notice the time going by.\nAnd it is always delightful to stroll in Lisbon. I took so many photos of narrow streets like this one in Barrio Alto. I picked one last photo to share.\nLooking back on the photos, we enjoyed a tremendous variety of fun experiences all centered on Lisbon. People were friendly, everything was easy to do, and there were so many great choices for each day. Of course, any trip is only good as the person you are with. I was glad to be with my beautiful wife Audrey.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>In May 2023, we returned from Portugal with over 400 photos. Here I pick just a few favorites, choosing photos with a story to tell. A separate photo album covers our time in  <a href="/posts/photos/2023-madiera/">Magical Madiera</a>.</p>
<h2 id="arrival-in-cascais">Arrival in Cascais<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#arrival-in-cascais">#</a></h2>
<p>The idea to visit Portugal began with an invitation from the Jacobs Foundation to attend a <a href="https://jacobsfoundation.org/2023-jacobs-foundation-conference/">conference</a> on the theme of how learners can adapt to changing world. As the timing fit my 60th birthday, Audrey and I decided to make it a birthday trip.</p>

<p>Often we could ride the scenic #12 or #28 tram back to the Alfama district. We were wanred that the trams were pickpocket risks, but we didn&rsquo;t have any issues. We rode many trams. Upon arriving back in the Alfama, we&rsquo;d stroll down a quiet alley which ended at our hideway hotel.</p>

<h2 id="food-modern-meets-traditional">Food: Modern Meets Traditional<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#food-modern-meets-traditional">#</a></h2>
<p>I expected to find traditional foods like Sardines in Portugal, but didn&rsquo;t expect all the creative adaptations of their cuisine to modern tastes and techniques. One quirky find was <a href="https://miss-can.com/en/">Miss Can</a>, a hipster sardine bar, pictured below. Just sardines on fresh bread &ndash; delicious! And it was just steps away from our hotel.</p>
<p>Also near our hotel was a restaurant called Audrey&rsquo;s Bistro and of course we had to eat there! We ate at everything from a Michelin two-star restaurant to the Time Out food hall to little modern and traditional cafes, and it was all delicious.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-17.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# Miss Can Sardine Restaurant #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of too many dishes at a Michelin 2-star, featuring edible gold foil. Lisbon is a relatively affordable place to check out a Michelin-starred restaurant.</p>

<h2 id="jacaranda-season">Jacaranda Season<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#jacaranda-season">#</a></h2>
<p>May was a beautiful time to visit, and especially because Lisbon was full of purple jacaranda trees in bloom. It is a delightful city for strolling, with discoveries around every corner. We had perfect temperatures, although it was sometimes a bit windy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-18.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# a path with a Jacaranda tree #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<h2 id="graffiti">Graffiti<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#graffiti">#</a></h2>
<p>Portugal is colorful in another unexpected way: graffiti is abundant. They keep the monuments and most important places clean, but everything else is covered in paint. And Lisbon is a city of contrasts. Much of historical Lisbon has been bought up by foreigners on Golden Visas. But then again, there are some extremely poor sections, like Alfama, which still have local residents. The graffiti is a reminder that Portugal is still undergoing massive economic transitions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-21.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# a cityscape with lots of graffiti #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<h2 id="getting-around">Getting Around<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#getting-around">#</a></h2>
<p>We really enjoyed all the forms of transportation. We took trams and buses, as well as the famous funicular pictured here. We rode scooters. We found Ubers to be ridiculously inexpensive. And we took trains. It was all easy to navigate.</p>
<p>A few times we used the Glória Funicular, which goes up a very steep grade. At the top is a park with an amazing view. At the bottom, the best gelato! Here one upward-bound and one downward-bound funicular meet at the middle as they go up and down the hill, with people walking alongside the tracks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-22.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# the funicular #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<p>After a particularly delicious gelato, we considered riding this famous elevator, which goes up a hill between neighborhood. But there was a long line, so I just got the photo.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-35.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# a street elevator at night #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<h2 id="jerónimos-monastery">Jerónimos Monastery<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#jerónimos-monastery">#</a></h2>
<p>Of touristy things in Lisbon, the Jerónimos Monastery stood out as most worth doing. We had a heck of time getting there because there was a marathon in the streets the day we went. Trams weren&rsquo;t running and we ended up in a packed bus full of runners wearing numbered cards. And there was a long line. But it was worth it.</p>
<p>The Manueline architecture is very ornate, and I took lots of photos through arches of the spires. But I especially liked a telephoto shot of a well-preserved gargoyle, a snake eating a clam.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-19.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# looking through an archway at the monestary #&amp;gt;"  />

</p>
<h2 id="sintra">Sintra<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sintra">#</a></h2>
<p>A great day trip is to Sintra; we took the train there. Sintra is beautiful hillside where the rich built their summer palaces, about 10 miles away from the sea, so as to catch the perfect breezes.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, we decided to walk into town rather than following the lemmings onto the tourist bus. We were glad we did, because we had a very quiet time in the National Palace. We took the English self-guided audio tour, and loved it. As pictured below, it really projects Portugal&rsquo;s past power. Indeed, everywhere you go in Portugal there are symbols related to boats and navigation, the source of ancient power.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-27.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# the outside of the National Palace  #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<p>Then we went up to the Moorish Castle, atop the hill. It is a thousand years old and amazingly atmospheric. We loved climbing about on the castle walls.</p>
<p>The most famous attraction, however, disappointed. The Pena Palace is a relatively modern fantasy. It had a complex ticket timing system, and we blew it, so we ended up waiting around for a long time to go inside. And in the end, it wasn&rsquo;t worth it &ndash; the National Palace is a much better tour. It is colorful, however. Very instagram friendly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-15.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# The Pena Palace  #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<p>And after our much delayed tour of the Pena Palace we were running late for our train, so we took a Tuk Tuk on an amazingly wild ride down the mountain. We just barely made our train.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-13.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# Jeremy and Audrey in a Tuk Tuk  #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<h2 id="évora">Évora<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#évora">#</a></h2>
<p>Our other day trip was to Évora, and we had to wake up very early to catch the train. We were rewarded by a magical sunrise in Lisbon, looking up the Alfama hill where we were staying. We got to Évora in time for a little breakfast, and were horrible Americans who rushed through our coffee and croissant, much to the owner&rsquo;s dismay.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-14.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# sunrise over Lisbon #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<p>From Évora, we took a tour to see the ancient monoliths (a bit like Stonehenge), and that tour was really interesting. But the big surprise was happening upon a harvest in a cork forest. The tour guide stopped the van and we all watched cork being expertly peeled from a tree and loaded on a truck.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-25.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# harvesting cork #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<p>We also toured around Évora, but our guide was disappointing. It&rsquo;s a nice place to learn about the Inquisition. And a nice small walled town. But overall, not a must see. And from Lisbon, it&rsquo;s quite a long day trip. Although we were exhausted when we got back to our hotel in Lisbon, the hotel was featuring a private Fado concert that night. The wonderufl music ended being another highlight of the trip.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-30.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# black and white photo of Evora #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<h2 id="jewish-tour-extraordinaire">Jewish Tour Extraordinaire<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#jewish-tour-extraordinaire">#</a></h2>
<p>Audrey saved the best for last. She found and booked a Jewish walking tour. There isn&rsquo;t actually that much Jewish history to see in Lisbon. Yet <a href="https://www.lisbonexplorer.com/jewish-lisbon-tour-2.html">Professor Paolo Scheffer</a> was the most amazing tour guide ever. He is a historian and an activist for preservation of historical places and artifacts. We learned about 600 years worth of Portugese Jewish history and every moment was fascinating. There are proud moments, and tragic moments. Stupid moments, and small victories. Conspiracy theories and little known massacres. Myths debunked and new history in the making. It was supposed to last 3 hours but went on for at least 5 hours. We didn&rsquo;t even notice the time going by.</p>
<p>And it is always delightful to stroll in Lisbon. I took so many photos of narrow streets like this one in Barrio Alto. I picked one last photo to share.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/Portugal-16.jpg" alt="&amp;lt;# a narrow street in Lisbon  #&amp;gt;"  />
</p>
<p>Looking back on the photos, we enjoyed a tremendous variety of fun experiences all centered on Lisbon. People were friendly, everything was easy to do, and there were so many great choices for each day. Of course, any trip is only good as the person you are with. I was glad to be with my beautiful wife Audrey.</p>
