With three fiddles, a pedal steel guitar, at least a half dozen singers, and more, we couldn&rsquo;t go wrong. The music was a mix of country-western songs with lots of spirited improvisations, as Monday night is the night for the musicians to have fun. The night&rsquo;s featured singer, Wendy, had been on The Voice and was wonderful. I also was amazed by the pedal steel player who produced tasty licks and precision high speed runs all night long.">
