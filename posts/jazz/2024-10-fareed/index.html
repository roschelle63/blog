The 1901 Stoughton Opera House is a historical gem. It&rsquo;s set at one end of main street, and Stoughton has a classic midwest mainstreet look.

I learned of the show because Madison has a community radio station, WORT, and earlier in the week they interviewed Fareed. On the strength of what I heard on the radio, I decided to check it out.\nThe 1901 Stoughton Opera House is a historical gem. It’s set at one end of main street, and Stoughton has a classic midwest mainstreet look. I wandered in to the building and earnest greeters in white shirts and black pants let me know that the opera house was upstairs. Up a steep staircase I went, soon arriving in a restored auditorium with a balcony, boxes, and golden oak seating.\nThe impressario asked who was here for the first time, and I was one of the few. I was instructed, jokingly, to meet him outside between sets to explain my delinquency. He rambled as if he knew most of the people in the audience and was entertaining them in his backyard. He informed us that October was “bat season” and the opera house had a resident bat named “Fred.” Fred might fly out because he likes string instruments, and we shouldn’t worry because his talons were not strong enough to pick up adults. Ah, but you might want to hold onto your children!\nBoo!\nFareed Haque, a virtuoso, began the set playing Mozart on a classical guitar. Soon he brought his group onto the stage and introduced a jazzy tune from Haiti. Throughout the two sets, we enjoyed jazz fusion sounds with a range of world music tunes. His group featured a bass player, a drummer, a latin percussionist, and sometimes an Indian singer who also played a harmonium.\nAfter a blazing first set, the audience was invited to exit the auditorium and relax in the first floor bar. There was a comfy living room with sofas, dim lighting, and the sound of recent concerts wafting in through speakers.\nThe second set was equally wonderful. Fareed can play blazingly fast, and overall has a stylistic resemblance to John McLaughlin. At times the band sounded like Shakti. At other times, like Pat Metheny or other jazz fusion groups. I think its fair to say Fareed has a sound all his own, with wide-ranging tastes and few limits to his talent.\nThe energy was high, musicianship impressive, and the audience was highly engaged. The guy behind me kept muttering “it’s so many notes, so many notes, so many notes!” I guess Fareed played as many notes in a night as Stoughton normally hears in a year.\nDetails Location: Stoughton Opera House, Wisconsin Date: October 18, 2024 Attending: Jeremy ",
