He took the stage with his own quartet and at 85 years old, he probably had more years than the drummer, bass, and sax player combined. But his sound was still spritely and he didn’t miss a note. Bob is a composer often featured at your favorite “smooth jazz” setting of the radio dial, with a nack for writing tunes with memorable hooks. He played many of his classic compositions and a few covers. His band featured a talented young drummer and energetic bass player. And the Ukrainian sax player Andrey Chmut played several powerful solos, too.\nLater in the evening, during the set led by Marcus Miller, Bob James came back on for the classic song “Maputo.” The most memorable moment of the evening for me was Marcus and Bob “trading fours” – each playing a short riff that copied the other. They were clearly having a great time in musical conversation.\nFor his set, Marcus Miller played songs from his long association with David Sanborn, who passed away recently. Marcus plays a deep, funky groove without ever breaking into a sweat, and freely shares his joy in his bandmates’ work. With a lineup of four horns, his set had a lot of variety. A highlight was the song originally sun by Al Jarreau called Since I fell for you. Larry Braggs absolutely brought the house down with his rendition, which begins at a whisper levels and rises to a passionate howl.\nKirk and I also really enjoyed the Blackbyrds, a classy funk back with deep roots in DC. We also liked walking around the extensive grounds of the pavilion, which included a second stage set in the woods and a jazz arts and crafts fair.\nOverall, it was a rainy day, and we were glad we traded up for real seats under the roof, and not for a waterlogged spot on the grass. The festival had a fun, friendly vibe, and I’d be glad to go again.\nDetails Location: Merriweather Post Pavillion Date: June 8, 2025 Attending: Kirk, Jeremy ",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Without question, Bob James stole the show at the 2025 Capital Jazz Festival. He took the stage with his own quartet and at 85 years old, he probably had more years than the  drummer, bass, and sax player combined. But his sound was still spritely and he didn&rsquo;t miss a note. Bob is a composer often featured at your favorite &ldquo;smooth jazz&rdquo; setting of the radio dial, with a nack for writing tunes with memorable hooks. He played many of his classic compositions and a few covers. His band featured a talented young drummer and energetic bass player.
