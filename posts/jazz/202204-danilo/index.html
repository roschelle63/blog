<meta name="description" content="Danilo Peréz&rsquo;s Global Messengers
I&rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of Wayne Shorter&rsquo;s quartet with Danilo Peréz, John Pattituci and Brian Blade. And I enjoy each of the artists individually. So I leaped at a chance go hear the pianist, Danilo Peréz lead his own group.
The setting could not be more beautiful. The 6th and I Synagogue is a historic building in downtown Washington DC, and its a Sephardic-style building. Rather than a long vault ending in an alter, the building is basically square, with a dome above four huge arches. The dome is pained a lovely sky blue. And the colors throughout the space are warm and inviting. I had been looking for an opportunity to show Audrey the space and it was a special bonus that Sarah was visiting us.">

We learned that Charles Fishman, a VIP of DC jazz was in the house for his birthday and Danilo reached into his catalog to play a request he had not played in 30 years. The Panama cultural attaché was in the house (Danilo hails from Panama) and so he also played a familiar song, and many in the audience joined in the call-and-response singing.
