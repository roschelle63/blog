I started with the acoustic jazz of George Cables and James Francies at the Stanford Jazz Workshop, then the highly amplified Afro-futurist jazz-funk of Kamasi Washington, and finally an arena show with The Chicks. The Chicks show was a lot of fun, with hordes of screaming female fans, some cute kids all around us, and overall high spirits. But it takes an hour to get in and out of parking and the quality of the sound system really didn’t do justice to how talented the Chicks are. Kamasi in a small club venue was amazingly powerful, the sound system was awesome, the hassle factor was zero and we could get as close as we wanted to the musicians. And as clear in the Stanford Workshop show, with jazz, you can get up close and personal with the greatest musicians in jazz with no hassle at all. And cutting frontmen like Joshua Redman and Jeremy Pelt show up to play with their seniors, like George Cables.\nOne really nice closing moment was when one of the Chicks walked off the stage and up the aisle where we were sitting.\nSetlist The Chicks played for about two hours. My favorites where Gaslighter, The Long Way Around, and the Fleetwood Mac cover, Landslide. “For her” was very moving, too.\nSin Wagon Gaslighter Texas Man Julianna Calm Down The Long Way Around My Best Friend’s Weddings Sleep at Night Mississippi (Bob Dylan cover) Wide Open Spaces Tights on My Boat Lubbock or Leave It Cowboy Take Me Away Long Time Gone Landslide (Fleetwood Mac cover) Don’t Let Me Die in Florida (Patty Griffin cover) March March For Her White Trash Wedding Everybody Loves You Set Me Free Not Ready to Make Nice Travelin’ Soldier (Bruce Robison cover) Goodbye Earl Details Location: Shoreline Ampitheater Date: July 30, 2022 Attending: Audrey, Jeremy ",
