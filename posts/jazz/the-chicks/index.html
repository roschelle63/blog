I started with the acoustic jazz of George Cables and James Francies at the Stanford Jazz Workshop, then the highly amplified Afro-futurist jazz-funk of Kamasi Washington, and finally an arena show with The Chicks. The Chicks show was a lot of fun, with hordes of screaming female fans, some cute kids all around us, and overall high spirits. But it takes an hour to get in and out of parking and the quality of the sound system really didn’t do justice to how talented the Chicks are. Kamasi in a small club venue was amazingly powerful, the hassle factor was zero and we could get as close as we wanted to the musicians. And as clear in the Stanford Workshop show, with jazz, you can get up close and personal with the greatest musicians in jazz with no hassle at all.
