We’re temporarily based in Madison while Audrey works here on Voter Protection. The concert venue was just a 10 minute walk from our apartment—Madison is very walkable town. And we enjoyed a pre-concert gathering at the adjacent glass apartment tower, where Audrey’s new colleagues have a beautiful apartment. Their balcony looked over the concert venue and had a beautiful view across both of the lakes that surround the Madison isthmus.\nFrom the balcony, we were able to listen to the opening act, “Kingfish” Ingram. Kingfish treated us to B.B. King-like blues licks.\nTrain took the stage just before 8:30 pm, and quickly ran through a half dozen hits. “Save me, San Francisco” took us back home with its lyric “If I could wish upon a star, I would hitch a cable car.” Slowly the sun went down as they played. They included some surprise covers. I didn’t know “Lose Control” but it was fun to tag “Hey Jude” at the end of their song “Drive By.” They also did a great job on a cover of “Hotel California” during the encore.\nThe state of Wisconsin has less population than just the San Francisco Bay Area, and it was fun and different to see a famous band in a smaller place. As I mentioned, we just strolled over to the venue, and afterwards, it took zero time to walk out. Audrey was in Bay Area mode as was looking for how we could find the best exit to quickly escape before it all clogged up with people, but there was no clog walking out the main gate. Breese Stevens Field is a soccer stadium, and the Train concert seating occupied one third of the field.\nThe next night, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss take the stage at the same venue (!)\nSetlist Calling All Angels Get to Me Save Me, San Francisco Meet Virginia If It’s Love Bruises Marry Me When I Look to the Sky Lose Control (Teddy Swims cover) Angel in Blue Jeans Parachute Play That Song Long Yellow Dress 50 Ways to Say Goodbye Hey, Soul Sister Drive By / Hey Jude (Beatles cover) Encore:\nWe Were Made for This Hotel California (Eagles cover) Drops of Jupiter Details Location: Breese Stevens Field, Madison, Wisconsin Date: June 7, 2024 Attending: Jeremy, Audrey ",
