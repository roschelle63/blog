<title>Charged Particles, Music of Michael Brecker | Jeremy Roschelle</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="Jacob">
<meta name="description" content="On a visit with Jacob in Denver, we looked at the last minute for some live music and discovered that Charged Particles was playing in downtown Denver. They were playing music of Michael Brecker, who was one of the heros of jazz in my high school years. For example, check out this 1980 performance of Some Skunk Funk.
Although Michael Brecker has passed away, his brother Randy joined the set on trumpet. And Tod Dickow was up to the task of Michael&rsquo;s precise, high energy lines on tenor sax. We enjoyed a wonderful set with super talented musicians. Charged Particles has an album called Live at the Baked Potato on Spotify, if you want to check it out.">
